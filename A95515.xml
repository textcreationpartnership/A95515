            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He duty of Repentance is of ſo great and univerſal concernment, a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicon to the evils of the Soul of every man, that if there be any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in which it is worthy the labours of the whole <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Calling, to be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> it is in this duty; and therefore I hope I ſhall be excuſed, if my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of Repentance, like the duty it ſelf, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually increaſing; and I may, like the Widow in the Gospel to the unjuſt Judge, at leaſt hope to prevail with ſome men by my importunity. Men have found out ſo many devices and arts to couſen themſelves, that they will rather admit any weak
<pb facs="tcp:115796:4"/>diſcourſes and images of Reaſon, then think it neceſſary to repent <hi>ſpeedily, ſeverely and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively.</hi> Wee finde that ſinners are proſperous, and God is long before he ſtrikes; and it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes another mans caſe, when we ſee a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happen upon a ſinner, we feel it not our ſelves, for when we doe, it is commonly paſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Indeed it was to be pitied in the Heathen, that many of them were tempted to take the thriving ſide, when Religion it ſelf was unproſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. When <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſuffered his golden Scepter to be ſtole, and the Image never frown'd; and a bold fellow would ſcrape the Ivory thigh of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and go away without a broken pate, for all the Club that was in his hand; they thought they had reaſon to think there was no more ſacred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Images of their gods, then in the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of <hi>Vigellus:</hi> and becauſe the event of all regular actions was not regular and equal, but <hi>Catiline</hi> was hewn down by the Conſuls ſword for his Rebellion, and for the ſame thing <hi>Caeſar</hi> became a Prince, they believed that the Powers that govern'd theſe extregular events, muſt it ſelf be various and changeable, and they call'd it <hi>Fortune.</hi> But (My Lord) that Chriſtians
<pb facs="tcp:115796:4"/>ſhould thus dote upon temporal events, and the little baits of fiſhes and the meat of dogs, adoring every thing that is prosperous, and hating that condition of things that brings trouble, is not to be pardon'd to them who profeſs themſelves Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Diſciples of a Crucified Lord and Maſter. But it is upon the ſame account that men are ſo hardly brought to repent, or to believe that Repentance hath in it ſo many parts, and requires ſo much labour, and exacts ſuch caution, and cannot be performed without the beſt aſsiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or the greateſt skill in spiritual notices. They finde ſin pleaſant and prosperous, gay and in the faſhion: And though wiſe men know <hi>it is better to be pleas'd then to be merry</hi> to have reſt and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in wiſdom and perfective notices of things, then to laugh loud, and fright ſobriety away with noiſes, and diſſolution, and forgetfulneſs: yet this ſeverer pleaſure ſeems dull and flat, and men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally betake themſelves to the wildneſſes of ſin, and hate to have it interrupted by the intervening of the ſullen grace of Repentance. It was a sprightly ſaying of him in the Comedy,
<pb facs="tcp:115796:5"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Ego vitam Deorum proptereà ſempi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam eſſe arbitròr,</l>
                  <l>Quòd voluptates eorum propriae ſunt. Nam mihi immortalitas</l>
                  <l>Parta eſt, ſi huic nulla aegritudo gaudio interceſſerit.</l>
               </q> 
               <hi>Our immortality is to be reckoned by the continuance of our pleaſure. My life is then perpetual, when my delights are not interrupted.</hi> And this is the immortality that too many men look after by incompetent means. But to be called upon to Repentance, and when men inquire what that is, to be told it is all the duty of a returning man; the extermination of ſin, the mortification of all our irregular appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, and all that perfection of righteouſneſs which can conſiſt with our ſtate of imperfection; and that in order to theſe purpoſes, we muſt not refuſe the ſharpeſt inſtruments, that <hi>they may be even cut off which trouble us,</hi> but that we ſuffer all the ſeverity of voluntary or impoſed diſcipline, according as it ſhall be judged neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is it which will trouble men: ſuch, I mean,
<pb facs="tcp:115796:5"/>who love a beggerly eaſe before a laborious thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving trade (a foul ſtable to ſome beaſts is better then a fair way) and therefore it is, that ſince all Chriſtians are convinced of the neceſsity, the indispenſable neceſsity of Repentance, they have reſolved to admit it, but they alſo reſolve they will not underſtand what it is. <hi>Una herclè falſa lachrymula;</hi> one or two forc'd tears againſt a good time: and (believe it) that's a great matter too, that is not ordinary. But if men loſe an eſtate,
<q>
                  <l>—Nemo dolorem</l>
                  <l>Fingit in hoc caſu, veſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diducere ſummam</l>
                  <l>Contentus, vexare oculos humore coacto.</l>
               </q> Men need not to diſſemble tears or ſorrow in that caſe: but as if men were in no danger when they are enemies to God, and as if to loſe heaven were no great matter, and to be caſt into hell were a very tolerable condition, and ſuch as a man might very well undergo, and laugh heartily for all that; they ſeem ſo unconcerned in the actions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in their obedience to the ſevere laws of Repentance, that it looks as if men had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne in the world, but to be ſuffered to die qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly
<pb facs="tcp:115796:6"/>to periſh tamely, without being troubled with the angry arguments of Churchmen, who by all means deſire they ſhould live and recover, and dwell with God for ever. Or if they can be forc'd to the further entertainments of Repentance, it is nothing but a calling for mercy, an ineffective prayer, a moiſt cloud, a reſolution for to day, and a ſolemn ſhower at the moſt.</p>
            <q>Mens immota manet, lachrymae vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vuntur inanes.</q>
            <p>The minde is not chang'd, though the face be: for Repentance is thought to be juſt as other Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, fit for their proper ſeaſon, like fruits in their own moneth; but then every thing elſe muſt have its day too: we ſhall ſin, and we muſt repent; but ſin will come again, and ſo may repentance: For <hi>there is a time for every thing under the Sun;</hi> and the time for Repentance is when we can ſin no more, when every objection is anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, when we can have no more excuſe; and they who go upon that principle will never doe it, till it be too late: For every age hath temptations of its own, and they that have been us'd to the yoke all
<pb facs="tcp:115796:6"/>their life time, will obey their ſin when it comes in any ſhape in which they can take any pleaſure. But men are infinitely abus'd, and by themſelves moſt of all. For Repentance is not like the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer fruits, fit to be taken a little, and in their own time; it is like bread, the proviſions and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of our life, the entertainment of every day, but it is <hi>the bread of affliction</hi> to ſome, and <hi>the bread of carefulneſs</hi> to all: and he that preaches this with the greateſt zeal, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt ſeverity, it may be he takes the liberty of an enemy, but he gives the counſel and the aſsiſtance of a friend.</p>
            <p>My Lord, I have been ſo long acquainted with the ſecrets of your Spirit and Religion, that I know I need not make an apology for dedicating this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Book to you. You know, according to the prudence which God hath given you, that he that flatters you is your enemy, and you need not be flattered; for he that deſires paſsionately to be a good man and a religious, to be the ſervant of God and be ſav'd, will not be fond of any vanity, and nothing elſe can need to be flattered; but I have preſented to your Lordſhip this Diſcourſe, not onely to be a teſtimony to the world, how great a
<pb facs="tcp:115796:7"/>love, and how great an honour I have for you, but even by aſcribing you into this relation, to endear you the rather every day <hi>more and more</hi> to the ſevereſt Doctrines and Practiſes of Holineſs. I was invited to make ſomething of this by an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Perſon who is now with God, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd his needs ſhould be ſerv'd by my Miniſtery. But when I had entred upon it, I found it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to do it in order to more purpoſes, and in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the method of my other Studies. All which as they are deſigned to Gods glory and the Miniſtery of Souls, ſo if by them I can ſignifie my obligations to your Lordſhip, which by your great Nobleneſs do ſtill increaſe, I ſhall not eſteem them wholly ineffective even of ſome of thoſe purpoſes whither they are intended; for truly my Lord, in whatſoever I am or can do, I deſire to appear,</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE wiſer part of Mankinde hath ſeen ſo much trifling in the conduct of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, ſo much partiality, ſuch ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires of reputation, ſuch reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prevail by all means, ſo great mixture of intereſt in the contention, ſo much miſtaking of the main queſtion, ſo frequent excurſions into differing matter, ſo many perſonal quarrels, and pety animoſities, ſo many wranglings about thoſe things that ſhall never be helped, that is, the errors and infirmities of men; and after all this (which alſo muſt needs be conſequent to it) ſo little fruit and effect of queſtions, no man being the wiſer,
<pb facs="tcp:115796:8"/>or changed from error to truth, but from error to error moſt frequently: and there are in the very vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of truth ſo many incompetent, uncertain, and untrue things offered, that if by chance ſome truth be gotten, we are not very great gainers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when the whole account is caſt up, <hi>we</hi> ſhall finde, or elſe <hi>they that are diſintereſt</hi> will obſerve that there is more error then truth in the whole purchaſe; and ſtill no man is ſatisfied, and every ſide keeps its own, unleſs where folly or intereſt makes ſome few perſons to change; and ſtill more weakneſs and more impertinencies crowd into the whole affair upon every <hi>reply,</hi> and more yet upon the <hi>rejoynder,</hi> and when men have wrangled tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and vainly, they are but where they were; ſave onely that they may remember they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered infirmity, and, it may be, the tranſport of paſſions, and uncharitable expreſſions; and all this for an unrewarding intereſt, for that which is ſometimes uncertain in it ſelf, unrevealed, unuſeful, and unſatisfying; <hi>that</hi> in the event of things, and after being wearied for little or nothing, men have now in a very great proportion left it quite off, as unſatisfying waters, and have been deſirous of more material nouriſhment, and of ſuch notices of things and juſt aſſiſtances, as may promote their eternal intereſt.</p>
            <p>And indeed it was great reaſon and high time that they ſhould do ſo: for when they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in in rowing up and down uncertain ſeas, to finde ſomething that was not neceſſary, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain they would leſs attend to that which was more
<pb facs="tcp:115796:8"/>worthy their inquiry: and the enemy of mankinde knew that to be a time of his advantage, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſowed tares while we ſo ſlept; and we felt a real miſchief while we contended for an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary and phantaſtick good. For things were come to that paſs, that it was the character of a good man to be zealous for a Sect, and all of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry party reſpectively if they were earneſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient of contradiction, were ſure to be ſav'd by their own Preachers; and holineſs of life was not ſo ſeverely demanded, but that men believe their Countrey Articles; and Heaven gates at no hand might be permitted to ſtand open to any one elſe. Thence came hatred, variance, emulation and ſtrifes; and the Wars of Chriſtendome which have been kindled by Diſputers, and the evil lives which were occaſion'd and encouraged by thoſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, are the beſt confutation of the world of all ſuch diſputations.</p>
            <p>But now when we come to ſearch into that part of Theology which is moſt neceſſary, in which the life of Chriſtianity, and the intereſt of Souls, the peace of Chriſtendome, and the union of Mindes, the ſweetneſs of Society, and the ſupport of Government, the uſefulneſs and comfort of our lives, the advancement of Vertue, and the juſt meaſures of Honour; we finde many things diſordered, the Tables of the Commandements broken in pieces, and ſome parts are loſt and ſome diſorder'd, and into the very practiſe of Chriſtians there are crept ſo many material errors, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God made nothing plainer, yet now no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb facs="tcp:115796:9"/>is more difficult and involv'd, uncertain and diſcompos'd, then many of the great lines and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in Moral Theology: Nothing is more neglected, more neceſſary, or more miſtaken. For although very many run into holy Orders without juſt abilities, and think their Province is well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged if they can preach upon Sundays; and men obſerving the ordinary preaching to be little better then ordinary talk, have been made bold to venture into the Holy Sept, and invade the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the Temple, as thinking they can talk at the ſame rate which they obſerve to be the manner of vulgar Sermons: yet they who know to give a juſt value to the beſt things, know that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Office of a Prieſt, a Miniſter of Religion, does not onely require great holineſs, that they may acceptably offer the Chriſtian Sacrifices and Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Prayer and Euchariſt for the people, and become their faireſt examples; but alſo great abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and wiſe notices of things and perſons, ſtrict obſervation, deep remembrances, prudent appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, courage and caution, ſeverity and mercy, diligence and wiſdome, that they may diſpenſe the excellent things of Chriſtianity, to the ſame effect whither they were deſign'd in the Counſels of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, that is, to the glory of God and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of Souls.</p>
            <p>But it is a ſad thing to obſerve how weakly the Souls of men and women are guided; with what falſe meaſures they are inſtructed, how their guides oftentimes ſtrive to pleaſe men rather then to ſave them, and accordingly have fitted their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
<pb facs="tcp:115796:9"/>and Sermons with eaſy theoremes, ſuch which the Schools of learning have fallen upon by chance, or intereſt, or flattery, or vicious neceſſities, or ſuperinduc'd arts, or weak compliances. But from whatſoever cauſe it does proceed, we feel the thing: There are ſo many falſe principles in the inſtitutions and ſyſtemes of moral or Caſuiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Divinity, and they taught ſo generally, and beleeved ſo unqueſtionably, and ſo fitted to the diſpoſitions of men, ſo complying with their evil inclinations, ſo apt to produce error and confidence, ſecurity and a careleſs converſation, that neither can there be any way better to promote the intereſt of ſouls, nor to vindicate truth, nor to adorn the ſcience it ſelf, or to make Religion reaſonable and intelligible, or to promote holy life, then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuing our Schools and Pulpits, and private perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions from the beleeving ſuch propoſitions which have prevailed very much and very long, but yet which are not onely falſe, but have immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the lives of men, ſo as to become to them a ſtate of univerſal temptation from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and wiſdome of Holineſs.</p>
            <p>When therefore I had obſerved concerning the Church of <hi>England</hi> [which is the moſt excellently inſtructed with a body of true Articles, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Holineſs, with a diſpline material and prudent, with a Government Apoſtolical, with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities neither ſplendid nor ſordid, too great for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and too little for envy (unleſs ſhe had met with <hi>little people</hi> and <hi>greatly malicious</hi>) and indeed with every thing that could inſtruct or adorn a
<pb facs="tcp:115796:10"/>Chriſtian Church, ſo that ſhe wanted nothing but the continuance of peace, and what ſhe already was;] that amongſt all her heaps of excellent things, and Books by which her ſons have miniſtred to piety and learning both at home and abroad, there was the greateſt ſcarcity of Books of Caſes of Conſcience; and that while I ſtood watching that ſome or other ſhould undertake it according to the ability which God gave them; and yet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one found himſelf hindred or diverted, perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or diſabled, and ſtill the work was left undone, I ſuffered my ſelf to be invited to put my weak hand to this work, rather then that it ſhould not be done at all. But by that time I had made ſome progreſſion in the firſt preparatory diſcourſes to the work, I found that a great part of that learning was ſupported by principles very weak and very falſe: and that it was in vain to diſpute concerning a ſingle caſe whether it were lawful or no, when by the general diſcourſings of men it might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to live in ſtates of ſin without danger or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof, as to the final event of ſouls. I thought it therefore neceſſary by way of addreſs and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the publication of the particulars, that it ſhould appear to be neceſſary for a man to live a holy life; and that it could be of concern to him to inquire into the very minutes of his conſcience: For if it be no matter how men live, and if the hopes of heaven can well ſtand with a wicked life, there is nothing in the world more unneceſſary, then to enquire after caſes of Conſcience. And if it be ſufficient for a man at the laſt to cry for pardon for
<pb facs="tcp:115796:10"/>having all his life time neither regarded Laws nor Conſcience, certainly they have found out a better compendium of Religion, and need not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with variety of rules and cautions of careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a laſting holineſs; nor think concerning any action or ſtate of life, whether it be lawful or not lawful; for it is all one whether it be or no, ſince neither one nor the other will eaſily change the event of things.</p>
            <p>For let it be imagined, what need there can be that any man ſhould write caſes of Conſcience, or reade them, if it be lawful for a man thus to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve and ſpeak.</p>
            <p>I have indeed often in my younger years been affrighted with the fearful noiſes of damnation, and the Miniſters of Religion, for what reaſons they beſt know, did call upon me to deny my appetite, to croſs my deſires, to deſtroy my pleaſures, to live againſt my nature; and I was afraid as long as I could not conſider the ſecrets of things; but now I finde that in theri own Books there are for me ſo many confidences and ſecurities, that thoſe fears were moſt unreaſonable, and that as long as I live by the rules and meaſures of nature, I doe not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, or if I doe, I ſhall ſoon finde a pardon. For I conſider that <hi>the Commandements are impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,</hi> and what is not poſſible to be done we are not to take care of: and he that fails in one inſtance cannot be ſav'd without a pardon, not by his obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and he that fails in all may be ſav'd by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and grace. For the caſe is ſo, that <hi>we are ſinners naturally,</hi> made ſo before we were born; and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb facs="tcp:115796:11"/>can never be changed until ſhe be deſtroyed: and ſince all our irregularities ſpring from that root, it is certain they ought not to be imputed to us; and a man can no more fear Gods anger for being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to all ſin, then for being hungry, or miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: and therefore I expect from the wiſdome and goodneſs of God ſome proviſions which will ſo extinguiſh this ſolemne and artificial guilt, that it ſhall be as if it were not. But in the mean time <hi>the certainty of ſinning will proceed.</hi> For beſides that I am told that <hi>a man hath no liberty, but a liberty to ſin,</hi> and this definite liberty is in plain Engliſh a very neceſſity, we ſee it by a daily experience that thoſe who call themſelves <hi>good men, are ſuch who doe what they would not, and cannot doe what they would;</hi> and if it be ſo, it is better to doe what I have a minde to quietly, then to vex my ſelf, and yet doe it never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs: and that it is ſo, I am taught in almoſt all the diſcourſes I have read or heard upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Chapter to the <hi>Romans:</hi> and therefore if I may have leave to doe conſonantly to what I am taught to beleeve, <hi>I muſt confeſs myſelf to be under the dominion of ſin,</hi> and therefore muſt obey; and that I am bidden to obey unwillingly, and am told that the <hi>ſtriving againſt ſin is indeed ordinarily inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and yet is a ſign of regeneration;</hi> I can ſoon doe that; I can ſtrive againſt it, and pray againſt it; but I cannot hope to prevail in either, becauſe I am told before-hand, that even <hi>the regenerate are under the power of ſin; they will and doe not; they do and will not;</hi> and ſo it is with me; I would fain be perfect if I could; but I muſt not hope it; and
<pb facs="tcp:115796:11"/>therefore I would onely doe my actions ſo reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, that I would not be tied to vex my ſelf for what I cannot help; or to loſe the pleaſure of my ſin by fretting at it, when it is certain it will be done, and yet I ſhall remain in the ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. And who can help all this, but God, whoſe mercy is indeed infinite; and although in the ſecret diſpenſation of affairs, he hath concluded all under ſin, yet he had no purpoſe we ſhould therefore periſh; but it was done that he might have mercy upon all; that is, that we may glorify him for ſupplying our needs, pardoning our ſins, relieving our infirmities? And therefore when I conſider that Gods mercy hath no limit in it ſelf, and is made definite onely by the capacity of the object, it is not to be doubted, but he loves his creatures ſo well, that we ſhall all rejoyce in our being freed from eternal fears. For to juſtify my hopes, why may not I be confident of heaven for all my ſins, ſince the imputation of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is that by which I ſhall be juſtified? my own is but <hi>like a menſtruous rag,</hi> and <hi>the juſt fals ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times a day;</hi> but Chriſts Croſs pays for all. And therefore I am confident I ſhall do well. For I am one of thoſe for whom Chriſt died; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve this, this faith is not to be reprov'd, for <hi>this is that which juſtifies, who ſhall condemne me? It is not a good life that juſtifies a man before God,</hi> but it is faith in the ſpecial promiſes; for indeed it being impoſſible to live innocently, it is neceſſary that a way of Gods own finding out ſhould be relied upon. Onely this indeed I doe, I doe avoid the
<pb facs="tcp:115796:12"/>capital ſins, blaſphemies, and horrid murders; I am <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I ſin like a Gentleman, not like a Thief;</hi> I ſuffer infirmities, but doe not doe like a Devil; and though I ſin, yet I repent ſpeedily, and <hi>when I ſin again, I repent again,</hi> and my ſpiritual ſtate is like my natural, day and night ſucceed each other by a never failing revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. <hi>I ſinne indeed in ſome inſtances, but I doe my duty in many;</hi> and <hi>every man hath his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> no man can ſay, My ſoul is pure from ſin; but I hope that becauſe I repent ſtill as I ſin, <hi>my ſinnes are but as ſingle actions;</hi> and ſince I reſiſt them what I can, I hope they will be reckoned to me but as <hi>ſinnes of infirmity,</hi> without which no man is, or can be in this ſtate of imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. For if I pray againſt a ſin, and my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit does reſiſt it, though the fleſh prevails, yet I am in the ſtate of grace. For that I may own publickly what I am publickly taught; <hi>a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſoon out of the ſtate of grace, but he may be ſoon in;</hi> Gods love is laſting and perpetual when it hath once begun; and when the curtain is drawn over the ſtate of grace by the intervening of a ſin, yet <hi>as ſoon as ever we begin to cry for pardon,</hi> nay <hi>when we doe but ſay, we will confeſs our ſinnes,</hi> nay <hi>when we doe but reſolve we will,</hi> God meets us with his pardon, and prevents us with ſome portions of it. And let things be at the worſt they can, yet he that confeſſeth his ſins to God, ſhall finde mercy at the hands of God; and he hath eſtabliſhed a holy Miniſtery in his Church to abſolve all penitents; and if I goe
<pb facs="tcp:115796:12"/>to one of them, and tell the ſad ſtory of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, <hi>the good man will preſently warrant my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and abſolve me.</hi> But then I remember this alſo, that as my infirmity that is unavoidable ſhall not prejudice me, ſo neither ſhall any time pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice my repentance. For <hi>if on my death-bed I cry unto God for pardon, and turn heartily unto God in the very inſtant of my diſſolution, I am ſafe;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when ever a man converts to God, in the ſame inſtant God turns to him, or elſe it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for God to hate him that loves God, and our repentance ſhould in ſome periods be reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, expreſly againſt all the promiſes. For <hi>it is an act of contrition, an act of the love of God that reconciles us;</hi> and I ſhall be very unfortunate, if in the midſt of all my pains, when my needs increaſe, and my fears are pregnant, and my ſelf am ready to accept pardon upon any terms, I ſhall not then doe ſo much as one act of a hearty ſorrow and contrition. But however, I have the conſent of almoſt all men, and all the Schools of learning in the world, that <hi>after a wicked life my repentance at laſt ſhall be accepted.</hi> Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> who was a good probable Doctor, and one as fit to be relied on as any man elſe, in his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Oration of <hi>Valentinian</hi> hath theſe words; <q>
                  <hi>Bleſſed is he truly, who even in his old age hath amended his error; Bleſſed is he who even juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſtroke of death turns his minde from vice. Bleſſed are they whoſe ſinnes are covered, for it is written, Ceaſe from evil, and doe good and dwell for evermore. Whoever therefore ſhall leave off
<pb facs="tcp:115796:13"/>from ſinne, and ſhall in any age be turned to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, he hath the pardon of his former ſinnes, which either he hath confeſſed with the affections of a penitent, or turned from them with the deſires of amends.</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>But this [Prince] hath company enough in the way of his obtaining pardon; For there are very many who could in their old age recal themſelves from the ſlipperineſſe and ſinnes of their youth; but ſeldome is any one to be found, who in his youth with a ſerious ſobri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety will bear the heavy yoke.</hi> And I remember that when <hi>Fauſtus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rhegium</hi> being asked by <hi>Paulinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nola</hi> from <hi>Marinus</hi> the <hi>Hermit,</hi> whether a man who was involved in car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſins and exerciſed all that a criminous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could doe, might obtain a full pardon, if he did ſuddenly repent in the day of his death? did anſwer peeviſhly, and ſeverely, and gave no hopes, nor would allow pardon to any ſuch; <hi>Avitus</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Vienna</hi> reproved his pride and his moroſity,
<note place="margin">Epiſt. 4.</note> and gave expreſs ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for the validity of ſuch a repentance: and that Gentleneſs hath been the continual Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Church for many ages; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in the year 1584 <hi>Henry Kyſpenning</hi> a Canon of <hi>Xant</hi> publiſhed a Book, intituled, <hi>The Evangelical Doctrine of the meditation of death, with ſolid exhortations and comforts to the ſick, from the currents of Scripture, and the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the Fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 11.</note> where teaching the ſick man how to anſwer the objections of Satan, he makes this to be the fifteenth: <hi>I repent too

<note place="margin">Lib. 7. c. 9.</note> 
               <hi>It is not late if it be true: and to the thief upon the Croſs Chriſt ſaid, This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe:</hi> And afterwards, <hi>a ſhort prayer eaſily pierceth heaven, ſo it be darted forth with a vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment force of the ſpirit. Truly the hiſtory of the Kings tels that</hi> David <hi>who was ſo great a ſinner, uſed but three ſyllables; for he is read to have ſaid no more but</hi> Peccavi, <hi>I have ſinned. For S.</hi> Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe <hi>ſaid, The flame of the ſacrifice of his heart aſcends up to heaven. Becauſe we have a merciful and gentle Lord; and the correction of our ſins needs not much time, but great fervor.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe are the words of <hi>Alcuinus</hi> the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Charls</hi> the Great: <hi>It behooves us to come to repentance with all confidence, and by faith to beleeve undoubtedly, that by repentance our ſins may be blotted out,</hi> Etiamſi in ultimo vitae ſpiritu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſa poeniteat, <hi>although we repent of our ſins in the laſt breath of our life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now after all theſe grounds of hope and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to a ſinner, what can be pretended in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a ſinful life; and ſince men will hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one ground, though it be trifling and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, when there are ſo many doctrinal grounds of hopes eſtabliſhed propoſitions, parts of Religion and Articles of faith to rely upon, (for, all theſe particulars before reckoned, men are called upon to believe earneſtly, and are hated and threatned and deſpiſed, if they do not believe them) what is there left to diſcourage the evil lives of men, or to leſſen a full iniquity, ſince
<pb facs="tcp:115796:14"/>upon the account of the premiſes, either we may do what we liſt without ſin, or ſin without puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or go on without fear, or repent without danger, and without ſcruple be confident of Heaven?</p>
            <p>And now if Moral Theology relie upon ſuch notices as theſe, I thought my work was at an end before I had well finiſhed the firſt ſteps of my progreſſion. The whole ſumme of affairs was in danger, and therefore I need not trouble my ſelf or others with conſideration of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I therefore thought it neceſſary firſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermine theſe falſe foundations; and ſince an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the minutes of conſcience is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the work of perſons that live holily, I ought to take care that this be accounted neceſſary, and all falſe warrants to the contrary be cancell'd, that there might be many <hi>idonei auditores,</hi> perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to hear and reade, and ſuch who ought to be promoted and aſſiſted in their holy intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And I bleſs God there are very many ſuch; and though iniquity does abound, yet Gods grace is conſpicuous and remarkable in the lives of very many, to whom I ſhall deſign all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of my life, as being dear to God, and my dear Brethren in the ſervice of Jeſus. But I would fain have the Churches as full as I could before I begin; and therefore I eſteem'd it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to publiſh theſe Papers before my other, as containing the greateſt lines of Conſcience, and the moſt general caſes of our whole life, even all the Doctrine of <hi>Repentance,</hi> upon which all the
<pb facs="tcp:115796:14"/>hopes of man depend through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But I have other purpoſes alſo in the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Book. The Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (who ever love to fiſh in troubled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to oppreſs the miſerable and afflicted, if they differ from them in a propoſition) uſe all the means they can to perſwade our people, that the man that is afflicted is not alive, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> now it is <hi>a perſecuted Church,</hi> is <hi>no Church</hi> at all; and though (bleſſed be God) our Propoſitions, and Doctrines, and Liturgy, and Communion are ſufficiently vindicated in deſpite of all their petty oppoſitions and trifling arreſts, yet they will never leave making noiſes and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries; which for my part I can eaſily neglect, as finding them to be nothing but noiſe. But yet I am willing to try the Rights and Excellencies of a Church with them upon other accounts; by ſuch indications as are the moſt proper tokens of <hi>life,</hi> I mean, propoſitions of Holineſs, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of a holy life: for certainly that Church is moſt to be followed, who brings us neareſt to God; and they make our approaches neareſt, who teach us to be moſt holy, and whoſe Doctrines command the moſt excellent and ſevereſt lives. But if it ſhall appear that the prevailing Doctrines in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> do conſequently teach, or directly warrant impiety, or which is all one, are too eaſie in promiſing pardon, and for it have no defences, but diſtinctions of their own invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I ſuppoſe it will be a greater reproof to their confidence and bold pretenſions, then a
<pb facs="tcp:115796:15"/>diſcourſe againſt one of their immaterial propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, that have neither certainty nor uſefulneſs. But I had rather that they would preach ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, then be reprov'd for their careleſs propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and therefore am well pleaſed that even amongſt themſelves ſome are ſo convinc'd of the weakneſs of their uſual Miniſteries of Repentance, that as much as they dare they call upon the Prieſts to be more deliberate in their abſolutions, and ſevere in their impoſitions of ſatisfactions, requiring a longer time of Repentance before the penitents be reconcil'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mounſieur Arnauld</hi> of the <hi>Sorbon</hi> hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared publickly in reproof of a frequent and eaſie Communion, without the juſt and long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of Repentance, and its proper exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes and Miniſterie. <hi>Petavius</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit</hi> hath oppos'd him; the one cries, <hi>The preſent Church,</hi> the other, <hi>The Ancient Church;</hi> and as <hi>Petavius</hi> is too hard for his adverſary in the preſent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſo <hi>Mounſieur Arnauld</hi> hath the cleareſt advantage in the pretenſions of Antiquity and the arguments of Truth; from which <hi>Petavius</hi> and his abettor <hi>Bagot the Jeſuit</hi> have no eſcape or defenſative, but by diſtinguiſhing Repentance into <hi>Solemn</hi> and <hi>Sacramental:</hi> which is juſt as if they ſhould ſay, <hi>Repentance is twofold; one,</hi> ſuch as was taught and practis'd by the Primitive Church; <hi>the other,</hi> that which is in uſe this day in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> for there is not ſo much as one pregnant teſtimony in Antiquity for the firſt four hundred years, that there was any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb facs="tcp:115796:15"/>thought of, but <hi>Repentance toward God,</hi> and ſometimes perform'd in the Church, in which after their ſtations were perform'd, they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the holy Communion; excepting onely in the danger or article of death, in which they haſtened the Communion, and enjoyn'd the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the afterwards completed, in caſe they did recover, and if they did not, they left the event to God. But this queſtion of theirs can never be ended upon the new principles, nor ſhall be freely argued becauſe of their intereſt. For who ever are obliged to profeſs ſome falſe propoſitions, ſhall never from thence finde out an intire truth, but like caskes in a troubled ſea, ſometimes they will be under water, ſometimes above. For the productions of errour are infinite, but moſt commonly monſtrous: and in the faireſt of them there will be ſome crooked or deformed part.</p>
            <p>But of the thing it ſelf I have given ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts as I could, being ingaged on no ſide, and the ſervant of no intereſt, and have endevour'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the dangers of every ſinner, the difficulty of obtaining pardon, the many parts and progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Repentance, the ſeverity of the Primitive Church, their rigid Doctrines and auſtere Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines, the degrees of eaſineſs and complyings that came in by negligence; and I deſire that the effect ſhould be, that all the pious and religious Curates of Souls in the Church of <hi>England</hi> would endevour to produce ſo much fear and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, caution and warineſs in all their peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, that they ſhould be willing to undergo
<pb facs="tcp:115796:16"/>more ſevere methods in their reſtitution then now they do: that men ſhould not dare to approach to the holy Sacrament, as ſoon as ever their foul hands are wet with a drop of holy rain; but that they ſhould expect the periods of life, and when they have given to their Curate fair teſtimony of a hearty Repentance, and know it to be ſo with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, they may with comfort to all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, communicate with holineſs and joy. For I conceive this to be that event of things which was deſign'd by S. <hi>Paul</hi> in that excellent advice; <hi>Obey them that have the rule over you,</hi>

It was neither fit that all ſhould be tied to it, nor yet that all ſhould throw it off. There are ſome ſins, and ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſome perſons to whom an actual Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery and perſonal proviſion and conduct by the Prieſts Office were better, then food or phyſick, It were therefore very well if great ſinners could be invited to bear the yoke of holy diſcipline,
<pb facs="tcp:115796:16"/>and do their Repentances under the conduct of thoſe who muſt give an account of them, that they would inquire into the ſtate of their ſouls, that they would ſubmit them to be judged by thoſe who are juſtly and rightly appointed over them, or <hi>ſuch whom they are permitted to chooſe;</hi> and then that we would apply our ſelves to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſecrets of Religion, the meaſures of the Spirit, the conduct of Souls, the advantages and diſadvantages of things and perſons, the wayes of life and death, the labyrinths of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and all the remedies of ſin, the publick and private, the great and little lines of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and all thoſe wayes by which men may be aſſiſted and promoted in the wayes of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: for ſuch knowledge as it is moſt difficult and ſecret, untaught and unregarded; ſo it is moſt neceſſary, and for want of it, the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt is oftentimes given to them that are in the gall of bitterneſs: <hi>that which is holy is given to Dogs.</hi> Indeed neither we nor our Forefathers could help it alwayes; and the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of the Church could ſeiſe but upon few: all were invited, but none but <hi>the willing</hi> could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the benefit; but however, it were pity that men upon the account of little and trifling ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, ſhould be diſcouraged from doing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves benefit, and from enabling us with greater advantages to do our duty to them. It was of old obſerved of the Chriſtians: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: they obey the laws, and by the excellency of their
<pb facs="tcp:115796:17"/>own lives excel the perfection of the laws: and it is not well, if we ſhall be earneſt to tell them that ſuch a thing is <hi>not neceſſary,</hi> if we know it to be <hi>good.</hi> For in this preſent diſſolution of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to tell the people concerning any good thing that it is not neceſſary, is to tempt them to let it alone.</p>
            <p>The Presbyterian Miniſters (who are of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> juſt as the <hi>Iriſh</hi> are <hi>Engliſh</hi>) have obtained ſuch power with their Proſelytes, that they take ſome account of the Souls (of ſuch as they pleaſe) before they admit them to their communion in Sacraments; they doe it to ſecure them to their party, or elſe make ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts to be as their <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> to diſcern their <hi>Jews</hi> from the men of <hi>Ephraim:</hi> but it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well we would doe that for Conſcience, for Charity, and for Piety, which others doe for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or <hi>Zeal;</hi> and that we would be careful to uſe all thoſe <hi>Miniſteries,</hi> and be earneſt for all thoſe <hi>Doctrines,</hi> which viſibly in the cauſes of things are apt to produce holineſs and ſevere living. It is no matter whether by theſe arts any <hi>Sect</hi> or <hi>Name</hi> be promoted; it is certain Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion would, and that's the reall intereſt of us all, that thoſe who are under our Charges ſhould know the force of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and the conduct of the Spirit, and live according to the purity of God, and the light of the Goſpel. To this let us cooperate <hi>with all wiſdome, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtneſs, and knowledge, and ſpiritual underſtanding.</hi> And there is no better way in the world to doe
<pb facs="tcp:115796:17"/>this, then by miniſtring to perſons <hi>ſingly</hi> in the conduct of their Repentance, which as it is the work of every man, ſo there are but few perſons who need not the conduct of a ſpiritual guide in the beginnings and progreſſions of it.</p>
            <p>To the aſſiſtance of this work I have now put my <hi>Symbol,</hi> having by the ſad experience of my own miſeries and the calamities of others, to whoſe reſtitution I have been called to miniſter, been taught ſomething of the ſecret of Souls: and I have reaſon to think that the words of our deareſt Lord to S. <hi>Peter</hi> were alſo ſpoken to me; <hi>Tu autem converſus confirma fratres.</hi> I hope I have received many of the mercies of a repenting ſinner, and I have felt the turnings and varieties of ſpiritual entercourſes; and I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the advantages in miniſtring to others, and am moſt confident that the greateſt benefits of our office may with beſt effect be communicated to ſouls in perſonal and particular Miniſtrations. In the following book I have given advices, and have aſſerted many truths in order to all this: I have endevoured to break in pieces almoſt all thoſe propoſitions, upon the confidence of which men have been negligent of ſevere and ſtrict living: I have cancell'd ſome falſe grounds upon which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny anſwers in Moral Theology us'd to be made to inquiries in Caſes of Conſcience: I have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my weak ability deſcribed all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities, and great inducements of a holy life; and have endevoured to do it <hi>ſo plainly,</hi> that it may be uſefull to every man, and <hi>ſo inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:115796:18"/>that it may hurt no man.</p>
            <p>I <hi>know</hi> but one Objection which I am likely to meet withall (excepting thoſe of my infirmity and diſability, which I cannot anſwer but by proteſting the piety of my purpoſes) but this onely, that in the Chapter of <hi>Original ſin,</hi> I ſpeak otherwiſe then is ſpoken commonly in the Church of <hi>England:</hi> whoſe ninth Article affirms, that <hi>the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity to evil, and the perpetual luſting of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit, deſerves the anger of God and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> againſt which I ſo earneſtly ſeem to diſpute in the ſixth Chapter of my Book. To this I anſwer, that it is one thing to ſay a thing <hi>in its own nature deſerves damnation;</hi> and another, to ſay <hi>it is damnable to all thoſe perſons in whom it is ſubjected.</hi> The thing it ſelf, that is, our <hi>corrupted nature,</hi> or our <hi>nature of corruption,</hi> does leave us in the ſtate of ſeparation from God, by being unable to bear us to heaven: imperfection of nature can never carry us to the perfections of glory; and <hi>this I conceive to be all that our Church intends:</hi> for that in the ſtate of nature we can onely fall ſhort of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and be condemn'd to a <hi>poena damni,</hi> is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt thing that any ſober perſon owns; and this I ſay, that Nature alone cannot bring us to God, without the regeneration of the Spirit, and the grace of God, we can never go to heaven: but becauſe this Nature was not ſpoil'd by Infants, but by perſons of reaſon, and we are all admitted to a new <hi>Covenant of Mercy</hi> and Grace, made with <hi>Adam</hi> preſently after his fall, that is, <hi>even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were born,</hi> as much as we were to <hi>a participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:115796:18"/>of ſin before we were born,</hi> no man can periſh actually for <hi>that,</hi> becauſe he is reconcil'd by <hi>this.</hi> He that ſayes every ſin is damnable, and deſerves the anger of God, ſayes true; but yet ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſin of meer infirmity are accounted by God in the rank of innocent perſons. So it is in this Article. <hi>Concupiſcence remains in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and yet concupiſcence hath the nature of ſin, but it brings not condemnation.</hi> Theſe words explain the former. Original imperfection is ſuch a thing as is even in the regenerate; and it is <hi>of the nature of ſin,</hi> that is, it is the effect of one ſin, and the cauſe of many; but yet it is not damning, becauſe as it is ſubjected in unconſenting perſons, it loſes its own natural venome, and relation to guiltineſs, that is, it may of it ſelf in its abſtracted nature be a ſin, and deſerve Gods anger, <hi>viz.</hi> in ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in all them that conſent to it: but that which will always be in perſons that ſhall never be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is in <hi>infants</hi> and <hi>regenerate,</hi> ſhall never damn them. <hi>And this is the main of what I affirm,</hi> And ſince the Church of <hi>England</hi> intended that Article againſt the Doctrine of the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> I ſuppoſe I ſhall not be thought to recede from the ſpirit and ſenſe of the Article, though I uſe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering manners of expreſſion; becauſe my way of explicating this queſtion, does moſt of all deſtroy the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie, ſince although I am deſirous to acquit the diſpenſation of God and his Juſtice from any imputation or ſuſpicion of wrong, and am loath to put our ſins upon the account of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet I impute all our evils to the imperfections
<pb facs="tcp:115796:19"/>of our nature and the malice of our choice, which does moſt of all demonſtrate not onely the <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Grace,</hi> but alſo of <hi>Infant Baptiſm;</hi> and then to accuſe this Doctrine of <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> or any newer name of Hereſie, will ſeem like impotency and weakneſs of ſpirit; but there will be nothing of truth or learning in it. And although this Article was penn'd according to the ſtyle of the Schools, as they then did love to ſpeak, yet the hardeſt word in it, is capable of ſuch a ſenſe as complies with the intendment of that whole ſixth Chapter. For though the Church of <hi>England</hi> profeſſes her ſelf fallible, and conſequently that all her truths may be peaceably improved; yet I do think that ſhe is <hi>not actually</hi> deceiv'd; and alſo that divers eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly learned do conſent in my ſenſe of that Article. However, I am ſo truly zealous for her honour and peace, that I wholly ſubmit all that I ſay there, or any where elſe to her moſt prudent judgement. And though I may moſt eaſily be deceived, yet I have given my reaſons for what I ſay, and deſire to be tried by them, not by prejudice, and numbers, and zeal: and if any man reſolves to underſtand the Article in any other ſenſe then what I have now explicated, all that I ſhal ſay is, that it may be I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reconcile my Doctrine to his explication; it is enough that it is conſiſtent with the Article it ſelf in its beſt underſtanding and compliance with the truth it ſelf, and the juſtification of God. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he that explicates the Article, and thinks it means as he ſays, does all the honour he can to the Authority; <hi>whoſe words if he does not underſtand, yet the ſanction he reverers.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:115796:19"/>
            <p>And this liberty I now take, is no other then hath been uſed by the ſevereſt Votaries in that Church where to diſſent is death, I mean in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I call to witneſs thoſe diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and contradictory aſſertions in the matter of ſome articles, which are to be obſerved in <hi>Andreas Vega, Dominicus à Soto, Andradius,</hi> the <hi>Lawyers</hi> about the Queſtion of divorces, and clandeſtine contracts, the Divines about predetermination, and about this very article of Original ſin, as relating to the Virgin <hi>Mary.</hi> But bleſſed be God, we are under the Diſcipline of a prudent, charitable, and indulgent Mother; and if I may be allowed to ſuppoſe, that the article means no more in ſhort, then the <hi>office of Baptiſm</hi> explicates at large, I will abide by the trial, there is not a word in the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricks or Prayers, but may very perfectly conſiſt with the Doctrine I deliver. But though the Church of <hi>England</hi> is my Mother, and I hope I ſhall <hi>ever live,</hi> and at laſt die in her Communion, and if God ſhall call me to it, and enable me, I will not refuſe to die for her; yet I conceive there is ſomething moſt highly conſiderable in that ſaying, <hi>Call no man Maſter upon earth;</hi> that is, no mans ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of her articles, ſhall prejudice my affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, if it agrees with Scripture and right reaſon, and the doctrine of the Primitive Church for the firſt 300 years; and if in any of this I am miſtaken, I will moſt thankfully be reproved, and moſt readily make honourable amends. But my propoſition, I hope, is not built upon the ſand: and I am moſt ſure it is ſo zealous for Gods honour, and the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb facs="tcp:115796:20"/>of his juſtice, and wiſdome, and goodneſs, that I hope all that are pious (unleſs they labour under ſome prejudice and prepoſſeſſion) will upon that account be zealous for it, or at leaſt confeſs that what I intend hath in it more of <hi>piety,</hi> then their <hi>negative</hi> can have of <hi>certainty. That which is ſtrain'd, and held too hard will ſooneſt break.</hi> He that ſtoops to the <hi>authority,</hi> yet twiſts the <hi>article</hi> with truth, preſerves both with modeſty and Religion.</p>
            <p>One thing more I <hi>fear</hi> will trouble ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who will be apt to ſay to me as <hi>Avitus</hi> of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna</hi> did to <hi>Fauſtus</hi> of <hi>Rhegium, Hic quantum ad frontem pertinet quaſi abſtinentiſsimam vitam profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, &amp; non ſecretam crucem, ſed publicam vanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi> &amp;c. That upon pretence of great ſeverity, as if I were exact or could be, I urge others to ſo great ſtrictneſs, which will rather produce deſpair then holineſs. Though I have in its proper place taken care concerning this, and all the way intend, to reſcue men from the juſt cauſes, and inlets to deſpair; that is, not to make them doe that againſt which by preaching a holy life, I have prepar'd the beſt defenſative; yet this I ſhall ſay here particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: That I think this objection is but a meer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe which ſome men would make, leſt they ſhould beleeve it neceſſary to live well. For to ſpeak truth, men are not very apt to deſpair, they have ten thouſand ways to flatter themſelves, and they will hope in deſpight of all arguments to the contrary; In all the Scripture there is but one example of a deſpairing man, and that was <hi>Judas;</hi> who did ſo, not upon the ſtock of any <hi>fierce propoſitions</hi> preach'd
<pb facs="tcp:115796:20"/>to him, but upon the load of his foul ſin, and the puſillanimity of his ſpirit. But they are not to be numbred who live in ſin, and yet <hi>ſibi ſuaviter bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicunt,</hi> think themſelves in a good condition; and all them that rely upon thoſe falſe principles which I have <hi>reckoned in this preface,</hi> and <hi>confuted in the Book,</hi> are examples of it. But it were well if men would diſtinguiſh the <hi>ſin of deſpair,</hi> from the <hi>miſery of deſpair.</hi> Where God hath given us no warrant to hope, there to deſpair is no ſin; it may be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and to hope alſo may be preſumption.</p>
            <p>I ſhall end with the moſt charitable advice I can give to any of my erring Brethren. Let no man be ſo vain as to uſe all the wit and arts, all the ſhifts and devices of the world, that he may behold to enjoy the pleaſure of his ſin, ſince it may bring him into that condition, that it will be diſputed, whether he ſhall deſpair or no. Our duty is to <hi>make our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and election ſure;</hi> which certainly cannot be done but by a timely and effective repentance But they that will be confident in their health, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times puſillanimous in their ſickneſs, preſumptuous in ſin, and deſpairing in the day of their calamity.

<pb facs="tcp:115796:21"/>Book to you, <hi>Moſt Reverend Fathers and Religious Brethren of this Church;</hi> and to your judgement I ſubmit what I have here diſcourſed of; as knowing that the chiefeſt part of the Eccleſiaſtical office is converſant about Repentance; and the whole Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Primitive Church was almoſt wholly imployed in miniſtring to the orders, and reſtitution and reconciliation of penitents; and therefore you are not onely by your <hi>ability,</hi> but by your <hi>imployment</hi> and <hi>experiences,</hi> the moſt compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges, and the apteſt promoters of thoſe truths by which repentance is made moſt perfect and unreprovable. By your <hi>Prayers,</hi> and your <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and your <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> I hope it will be more and more effected, that the ſtrictneſſes of a holy life be thought neceſſary, and that repentance may be no more that trifling, litle piece of duty, to which the errors of the late Schools of learning, and the deſires of men to be deceiv'd in this article, have reduc'd it. I have done thus much of my part toward it, and I humbly deſire it may be accepted by God, by you, and by all good men.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the firſt entercourſe with Man, God made ſuch a Covenant as he might juſtly make out of his abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and ſuch as was agreeable <hi>with thoſe powers</hi> which he gave us, <hi>and the inſtances</hi> in which obedience was demanded. For 1. Man was made perfect in his kinde, and God demanded of him perfect obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. 2. The firſt Covenant was <hi>the Covenant of Works,</hi> that is, there was nothing in it, but Man was to obey or die: but God laid but one command upon him that we finde; the Covenant was inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced but in one precept. In that he fail'd, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was loſt. There was here no remedy, no ſecond thoughts, no amends to be made. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe much was not required of him, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement was very eaſie, and he had ſtrengths more then enough to keep it, therefore he had no cauſe to complain: God might, and did exact at firſt the Covenant of Works, becauſe it was at firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely tolerable. But,</p>
                  <pb n="2" facs="tcp:115796:27"/>
                  <p>From this time forward this Covenant began to be hard,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and by degrees became impoſſible; not onely becauſe mans fortune was broken, and his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit troubled, and his paſſions diſordered and vext by his calamity and his ſin, but becauſe man upon the birth of children and the increaſe of the world contracted new relations, and conſequently had new duties and obligations, and men hindred one another, and their faculties by many means became diſorder'd and leſſen'd in their abilities; and their will becoming perverſe they firſt were unwilling, and then unable by ſuperinducing diſpoſitions and habits contrary to their duty. However, becauſe there was a neceſſity that man ſhould be tied to more duty, God did in the ſeveral periods of the world multiply Commandements, firſt to <hi>Noah,</hi> then to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and then to his poſterity; and by this time they were very many: And ſtill God held over mans head the Covenant of Works.</p>
                  <p>Upon the preſſure of this Covenant all the world did complain:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Tanta mandata ſunt, ut impoſſbile ſit ſervari ea,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In cap. 3. Gal.</note> ſaid S. <hi>Ambroſe:</hi> the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſo many and great, that it was impoſſible they ſhould be kept. For at firſt there were no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes at all of any good, nothing but a threatning of evil to the tranſgreſſors; and after a long time they were entertain'd but with the promiſe of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things, which to ſome men were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the pleaſures and rewards of ſin; and then there being a great imperfection in the nature of man, it could not be that man ſhould remain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and for repentance, in this Covenant there was no regard, or proviſions made. But I ſaid,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Covenant of Works was ſtill kept on foot;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> How juſtly, will appear in the ſequel; but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of it was in this, that men living in a ſtate of awfulneſs might be under a pedagogy or
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:115796:27"/>ſevere inſtitution reſtraining their looſeneſſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting their inadvertencies, uniting their diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. For the world was not then prepar'd by ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall uſages and diſpoſitions to be governed by love and an eaſie yoke, but by threatnings and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities. And this is the account S. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The Law was a Schoolmaſter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.24.</note> that is, had a temporary authority ſerving to other ends, with no finall concluding power. It could chaſtiſe and threaten, but it could not condemn: it had not power of eternall life and death, that was given by other meaſures. But becauſe the world was wilde and barbarous, good men were few, the bad potent and innumerable, and ſin was conducted and help'd forward by pleaſure and impunity, it was neceſſary that God ſhould ſuperinduce a law, and ſhew them the rod, and affright and check their confidences, leſt the world it ſelf ſhould periſh by diſſolution. The law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſtill a part of the Covenant of Works. Some little it had of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; Sacrifice and expiations were appointed for ſmall ſins; but nothing at all for greater. Every great ſin brought death infallibly. And as it had a little image of Repentance, ſo it had ſomething of Promiſes, to be as a grace and auxiliary to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward obedience. But this would not do it. The promiſes were temporall, and that could not ſecure obedience in great inſtances; and there being for them no remedy appointed by repentance, the law could not juſtifie, it did not promiſe life Eternall, nor give ſufficient ſecurity againſt the Temporall, onely it was brought in as a pedagogy for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>But this <hi>pedagogy</hi> or <hi>inſtitution</hi> was alſo a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuduction to the Goſpel.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> For they were uſed to ſevere laws, that they might the more readily enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the holy precepts of the Goſpel, to which eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:115796:28"/>they would have ſhut their ears, unleſs they had had ſome preparatory inſtitution of ſeverity and fear: And therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> alſo calls it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a pedagogy,</hi> or <hi>inſtitution lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it was this which made the world of the Godly long for Chriſt,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> as having commiſſion to open the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the hidden myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of Juſtification by Faith and Repentance. For the law called for exact obedience, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred no grace but that of fear, which was not enough to the performance or the engagement of exact obedience. All therefore were here convinced of ſin, but by this Covenant they had no hopes, and therefore were to expect relief from another and a better:
<note place="margin">Gal. 3.22.</note> according to that ſaying of S. <hi>Paul, The Scripture concludes all under ſin</hi> (that is, declares all the world to be ſinners) <hi>that the promiſe by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt might be given to them that beleeve.</hi> This S. <hi>Bernard</hi> expreſſes in theſe words, <hi>Deus nobis hoc fecit, ut noſtram imperfectionem oſtenderet, &amp; Chriſti avidiores nos faceret.</hi> Our imperfection was ſufficiently manifeſt by the ſeverity of the firſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, that the world might long for ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>For ſince mankinde could not be ſaved by the Covenant of works,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> that is, of exact obedience, they muſt periſh for ever, or elſe hope to be ſav'd by a Covenant of eaſe and remiſſion, that is, ſuch a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant as may ſecure Mans duty to God, and Gods mercy to Man, and this is the Covenant which God made with mankinde in Chriſt Jeſus, the Covenant of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>This Covenant began immediately after <hi>Adams</hi> fall.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> For as ſoon as the firſt Covenant, the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works was broken, God promiſed to make it up by an inſtrument of mercy which himſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:115796:28"/>would finde out. <hi>The Seed of the woman</hi> ſhould make up the breaches of the man. But this ſhould be acted and publiſhed in its own time, not preſently. In the mean time man was by virtue of that new Covenant or promiſe admitted to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adam</hi> confeſſed his ſin and <hi>repented.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years together did he mourn upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>India,</hi> and God promiſed him a Saviour by whoſe obedience his repentance ſhould be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. And when God did threaten the old world with a floud of waters, he called upon them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but becauſe they did not, God brought upon them the floud of waters. For 120. years together he called upon them to return before he would ſtrike his final blow. Ten times God tried <hi>Pharaoh</hi> before he deſtroyed him. And in all ages, in all periods, and with all men God did deal by this meaſure; and <hi>(excepting that God in ſome great caſes, or in the beginning of a Sanction to eſtabliſh it with the terror of a great example)</hi> he ſcarce ever deſtroyed a ſingle man with temporal death for any nicety of the law, but for long and great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications of it: and when he did otherwiſe, he did it after the man had been highly warned of the particular, and could have obeyed eaſily, which was the caſe of the man that gathered ſticks upon the Sabbath; and was like the caſe of <hi>Adam,</hi> who was upon the ſame account judged by the Covenant of works.</p>
                  <p>This then was an emanation both of Gods ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and his mercy.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> Until man had ſinned he was not the ſubject of mercy: and if he had not then receiv'd mercy, the infliction had been too ſevere and unjuſt, ſince the Covenant was beyond the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of man, after it began to multiply into parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular laws, and man by accident was leſſen'd in his ſtrengths.</p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:115796:29"/>
                  <p>From hence the corollaries are plain,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 1. God was not unjuſt for beginning his entercourſe with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by the Covenant of works, for theſe reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe Man had ſtrengths enough to doe it, until he leſſen'd his own abilities.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Covenant of works was at firſt inſtanc'd but in a ſmall Commandement: in abſtaining from the fruit of one tree, when he had by him very many others for his uſe and pleaſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was neceſſary that the <hi>Covenant of works</hi> ſhould begin: for the <hi>Covenant of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> could not be at firſt; there was no need of it, no opportunity for it, it muſt ſuppoſe a defailance, or an infirmity, as phyſick ſuppoſes ſickneſs and mortality.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God never exacted the obedience of Man by ſtrict meaſures, by the ſeverity of the firſt Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant after <hi>Adams</hi> fall; but men were ſav'd then as now, they were admitted to repentance, and juſtified by faith and the works of faith. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Jews ſay that three things were before the world, The Law, the name of the Meſſias, and Repentance;
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.7.</note> that is, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> better expreſſes it, This Repentance through faith in the Meſſias is <hi>the hidden wiſdome of God, ordained before the world unto our glory.</hi> So that at firſt it was not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; and when it was, it was not exacted in the impoſſible meaſure; but it was kept in pretence and overture for ends of piety, wiſdome and mercy, of which I have given account; it was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a wiſe diſpenſation, but it was hidden.</p>
                  <p>For ſince it is eſſentiall to a law that it be in a matter that is poſſible, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/>
                     <note place="margin">Plato lib 5. de leg. Demoſth. contra Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratem. Plutar. in Solon. Curius Fortunatianus Rhet. <hi>Nemo obligatur ad impoſſibile.</hi>
                     </note> it cannot be ſuppos'd that God would judge man by an impoſſible Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement. A good man would not doe it, much leſſe the righteous and mercifull Judge of Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:115796:29"/>But God by holding over the world the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of works, <hi>non fecit praevaricatores ſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miles,</hi> did not make us ſinners by not obſerving the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the minutes and tittles of the law, but made us humble, needing mercy, begging grace, longing for a Saviour, relying upon a better Covenant, waiting for better promiſes, praying for the Spirit of grace, repenting of our ſins, deploring our infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and juſtified by faith in the promiſes of God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> This then is the great introduction and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of repentance. We neither could have liv'd without it, nor have underſtood the way of the Divine Juſtice, nor have felt any thing of his moſt glorious attribute. But the admiſſion of us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, is the great verification of his juſtice, and the moſt excellent expreſſion of his mercy: This is the mercy of God in Jeſus Chriſt, ſpringing from the fountains of grace, purchas'd by the bloud of the Holy Lamb, the Eternal ſacrifice, promiſed from the beginning, always miniſtred to mans need in the ſecret Oeconomy of God, but proclaim'd to all the world at the revelation of <hi>God incarnate,</hi> the firſt day of our Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>But what are we eaſed now under the Goſpel,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> which is a Law of greater holineſs and more Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, and a ſublimer purity, in which we are tied to more ſeverity then ever man was bound to under any inſtitution and Covenant? If the Law was an impoſſible Commandement, who can ſay he hath ſtrictly and punctually perform'd the injunctions of the Goſpel? Is not the little finger of the Son heavier then the Fathers loyns? Here therefore it is to be inquired, Whether the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements of Jeſus Chriſt be as impoſſible to be kept as the Law of <hi>Moſes?</hi> If we by Chriſt be tied to more holineſs, then the ſons of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> Law, then becauſe that could not be kept, then
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:115796:30"/>neither can this. But if we be not tied to more then they, how is the law of Chriſt a more perfect inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and how can we now be juſtified by a law no better then that by which we could not be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified? But then, if this ſhould be as impoſſible as ever, why is it anew impoſed? why is it held over us, when the ends for which it was held over us, now are ſerved? And at laſt, how can it be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Gods wiſdome and juſtice, to exact of us a law which we cannot perform, or to impoſe a law which cannot juſtly be exacted? The anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and explicating this difficulty will ſerve many propoſitions in the doctrine of Repentance.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:115796:30"/>Commandements, though as yet no man ever did, but he that did it for us all. But as <hi>Marcellinus</hi> ſaid well, It is hard to ſay that by a Man a thing can be done, of which although there was a great neceſſity and a ſevere Commandement, yet there never was any example. Becauſe in men there is ſuch infinite variety of tempers, diſpoſitions, apprehenſions, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes, fears and hopes, purpoſes and intereſts, that it were next to a miracle that not one of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde ſhould do what he can, and what ſo highly concerns him. But becauſe this, although it be a high probability, yet is no certain demonſtration; that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught is certainly to be relied upon, <hi>That the Law could not do it for us,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> could not bring us juſtification, <hi>in that it was weak through the fleſh;</hi> meaning that becauſe we were ſo weak we could not fulfill the righteouſneſs of the Law, therefore we could not be juſtified by that Covenant. <hi>Moſi manus graves, facies cornuta, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedita lingua, lapideae tabulae. Moſes's</hi> hand were heavy, his face bright, his tongue ſtammering, and the tables were of ſtone; by which is meant, that the impoſition and the burthen was great, but the ſhoulder is weak and cruſhed, and therefore was not able to bear it; and therefore much leſs can it ſtand under a bigger load, if the holy Precepts of the Goſpel ſhould prove ſo, and we be aſſiſted by no firmer ſupporters.</p>
                  <p>For the nature and conſtitution of man is ſuch,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> that he cannot perpetually attend to any ſtate of things: <hi>Voluntas per momenta variatur,

It is (as S. <hi>Hieromes</hi> expreſſion is) as if a man ſhould hale a boat againſt the ſtream; if ever he ſlacken his hand, the veſſel falls back: and if ever we give way to our appetite in any of the forbidden inſtances, we deſcend naturally and eaſily. * Some vices are proportionable to a mans temper, and there he falls pleaſantly and with deſire;

                  <p>This moral demonſtration of the impoſſibility of perfect and exact obedience and innocence,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> would grow too high, if I ſhould tell how eaſily our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are ſowr'd even when we think we walk wiſely.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> He that offends not in his tongne, he is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man indeed. But experience and the following
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:115796:32"/>conſiderations do manifeſt that no man is ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For,</p>
                  <p>Every paſſion of the Soul is a ſpring and a ſhower,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> a parent and a nurſe to ſin. Our paſſions either miſtake their objects, or grow intemperate; either they put too much upon a trifle, or too little upon the biggeſt intereſt. They are material and ſenſual, beſt pleas'd and beſt acquainted with their own objects: and we are to do ſome things, which it is hard to be told how they can be in our own power. We are commanded to be angry, to love, to hope, to deſire certain things, towards which we cannot be ſo affected ever when we pleaſe. A man cannot love or hate upon the ſtock and intereſt of a Commandement, and yet theſe are parts of our duty. To mourn and to be ſorrowful are natural effects of their proper apprehenſions, and therefore are not properly capable of a law. Though it be poſſible for a man who is of a ſanguine complexion, in perfect health and conſtitution, not to act his luſt; yet it will be found next to impoſſible not to love it, not to deſire it: and who will finde it poſſible that every man and in all caſes of his temptation ſhould over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his fear? But if this fear be inſtanced in a matter of religion, it will be apt to multiply eternal ſcruples, and they are equivocal effects of a good meaning, but are proper and univocal enemies to piety and a wiſe religion.</p>
                  <p>I need not take notice of the infinite variety of thoughts and ſentences that divide all mankinde concerning their manner of pleaſing and obeying God;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> and the appendent zeal by which they are furiouſly driven on to promote their errors or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions as they think for God: and he that ſhall tell theſe men they do amiſs would be wondred at; for they think themſelves ſecure of a good reward even when they do horrible things. But the danger here
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:115796:33"/>is very great, when the inſtrument of ſerving God is nothing but opinion and paſſion abus'd by intereſt; eſpecially ſince this paſſion of it ſelf is very much to be ſuſpected; it being temerity or raſhneſs, (for ſome zeal is no better) and its very formality is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertency and inconſideration.</p>
                  <p>But the caſe is very often ſo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> that even the greateſt conſideration is apt to be miſtaken: and how ſhall men be innocent, when beſides the ſignal precepts of the Goſpel, there are propounded to us ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall meaſures, and as I may call them, <hi>extraregular lines,</hi> by which our actions are to be directed; ſuch as are, the analogie of faith, fame, reputation, publick honeſty, not giving offence, being exemplary; all which, and divers others being indefinite meaſures of good and evil, are purſued as men pleaſe, and as they will underſtand them. And becauſe concerning theſe, God alone can judge righteouſly, he alone can tell when we have obſerved them; we cannot, and therefore it is certain we very often doe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>
                  <p>Hence it is that they who mean holineſs and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are forc'd to make to themſelves rules and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by way of <hi>Idea</hi> or inſtrument,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> endevouring to chooſe that ſide that is the ſureſt; which indeed is but a gueſſing at the way we ſhould walk in; and yet by this way alſo, men do often run into a ſnare, and lay trouble and intricacy upon their conſciences, unneceſſary burthens which preſently they grow weary of, and in ſtriving to ſhake them off, they gall the neck, and introduce tediouſneſs of ſpirit or deſpair.</p>
                  <p>For we ſee when Religion grows high the dangers do increaſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> not onely by the proper dangers of that ſtate, and the more violent aſſaults made againſt Saints then againſt meaner perſons of no religious intereſt; but becauſe it will be impoſſible for any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:115796:33"/>man to know certainly what intenſion of ſpirit is the <hi>minimum religionis,</hi> the neceſſary condition, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or leſs then which God will not accept the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and yet ſometimes two duties juſtle one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and while we are zealous in one, we leſs attend the other, and therefore cannot eaſily be certain of our meaſures; and becauſe ſometimes two duties of a very different matter are to be reconcil'd and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, who can tell what will be the event of it, ſince mans nature is ſo limited and little that it cannot at once attend upon two objects?</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible that a man ſhould ſo attend his prayers,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> that his minde ſhould be alwayes preſent and never wander? does not every man complain of this, and yet no man can help it? And if of this alone we had cauſe to complain, yet even for this we were not innocent in others; and <hi>he that is an offender in one is guilty of all;</hi> and yet it is true that <hi>in many things we all offend.</hi> And all this is true when a man is well and when he is wiſe; but he may be fooliſh and he will be ſick, and there is a new ſcene of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, new duties, and new infirmities, and new que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and the old uncertainty of things, and the ſame certainty of doing our duty weakly, and imperfectly, and pitiably.</p>

                     <hi>To love God with all our faculties and degrees.</hi> In negative Precepts the meaſure is, <hi>Not to luſt or deſire.</hi> Now if any man can ſay that he can ſo love God in the proper and full meaſures, as never to ſtep aſide to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the creatures with whom he daily converſes, and is of the ſame kindred with them, and that he can ſo abſtain from the creature, as never to cover what he is forbidden; then indeed he juſtifies God in impoſing a poſſible law, and condemns himſelf that he does not what he ought. But in all he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the abſolute neceſſity of Repentance.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe we are ſure God is juſt and cannot be otherwiſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> all the Doctors of the Church have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devoured to tie theſe things together, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile our ſtate of infirmity with the juſtification of God. Many lay the whole fault upon Man, not on the impoſſible impoſition. But that being the Queſtion cannot be concluded on either hand with a bare Affirmative or Negative: and beſides, it was condemn'd by the African Councels to ſay, that a man might, if he pleas'd, live without ſin.

For the whole Church being a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of ſingle perſons is not the ſubject of a law. Nothing is univerſal but Names and Words; a thing cannot be univerſal, it is a contradiction to ſay it is. To ſay the Church can keep it, is to ſay that every man can keep it; To ſay that every man of the Church cannot keep it, is to ſay that the whole Church cannot keep it: As he that ſayes <hi>Mankinde is reaſonable,</hi> ſayes that <hi>every man is;</hi> but he that ſayes <hi>every man is not juſt,</hi> ſayes that <hi>all mankinde is not juſt.</hi> But if it contains in it another ſenſe, it is a dangerous affirmative, which I ſhall repreſent in his own words:

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:115796:35"/>by ſome vertues, though he retains ſome vices: <hi>For he that ſins in one is guilty of all.</hi> But yet ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſhall be crowned who never converted ſouls, and ſome that never redeem'd captives, and mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions that never ſold all and gave to the poor: and there are many graces, of which ſome lives have no opportunities. The ſtate of Marriage hath ſome graces proper to it ſelf; and the Calling of a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and the Office of a Judge, and the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an Advocate hath ſome things of vertue which others do not exerciſe, and they alſo have their proper graces: and in this ſenſe it is true what S. <hi>Hierome</hi> ſayes, that he that hath not all, may be juſtified by what he hath, and not ſentenced for what he hath not, it not being imputed to him that he hath not that of which he hath no uſe. Now although this be true, yet it is not ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the Queſtion: For the Commandements are not onely impoſſible in this ſenſe, but even in that where the ſcene of his duty does lie, and where his graces ought to have been exerciſed, every man is a ſinner, every man hath fail'd in his proper duty and calling. So that now to ſay the Commandements are poſſible to the whole Church, and not to every ſingle perſon, is to divide the duty of a Chriſtian, &amp; to give to every one a portion of duty, which muſt leave in every one a portion of impiety; and to ſay that this is keeping the Commandments, or a ſufficient means of juſtification, is that which S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> cal'd blaſphemy.</p>
                  <p>But S.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> 
                     <hi>Hierome</hi> hath another anſwer: <hi>Hoc &amp; nos dicimus, poſſe hominem non peccare ſi velit, pro tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,
<note place="margin">Dial. extr. adv. Pelag. l. 3.</note> pro loco, pro imbecillitate corporeâ, quamdiu intentus eſt animus, quamdiu chorda nullo vitio laxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in Citharâ.</hi> God hath not impos'd an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble law. For there is no Commandement, but a man that conſiders that endevours, that underſtands, that watches, that labours, may do in time and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:115796:35"/>place, and ſo long as he adverts, and is diſpaſſionate, ſo long as his inſtrument is in tune. Which anſwer is like that ſaying of the Schools, That there is no difficulty in things, but every thing is eaſie to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; but that we find difficulty, is becauſe of the weaknes of the underſtanding; that is, things are eaſie to be underſtood, if we were wiſe enough to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand them: But becauſe our underſtanding is weak, therefore things are hard; for to be intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is a relative term; and it is not ſenſe to ſay, that a thing is in it ſelf eaſie to be underſtood, but hard to the underſtanding; for it is as if it were ſaid, It is eaſie, but that it is hard: and that's the thing which in this queſtion is complain'd of on all hands. For an Oak is eaſie to be pull'd up by the roots, if a man had ſtrength enough to do it; but if this be impos'd upon a weak man or a childe, they have reaſon to complain: and a Buſhel or two of Wheat is no great thing to carry, but it is too great for me, I cannot do it. So by this account of S. <hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> the Commandements are not impoſſible, for there is not any one of them, but any man can do at ſome time, while he conſiders and is in perfect diſpoſition. But then we are to remember, that the Commandements are alwayes impoſed, and we are not alwayes in that condition of good things to be wiſe and watchful, well diſpos'd, and well reſolv'd, ſtanding upon our guard, and doing <hi>what we can at other times;</hi> and therefore it is that the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are impoſſible. So that ſtill the difficulty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains and the inquiry muſt go on, How we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the <hi>Divine Juſtice</hi> in exacting an impoſſible law? or if he does not exact it, how we underſtand the way of the <hi>Divine Wiſdome</hi> in impoſing that law which he cannot juſtly exact?</p>
                  <p>To the firſt I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> that God doth not exact of us what is not poſſible to be done. The higheſt ſeverity
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:115796:36"/>of the Goſpel is <hi>to love God with all our ſoul,</hi> that is, to love him as much as we can love him; and that is certain we can do. Every man can do as much as he can, and God requires no more: and even thoſe things which we can do, though he calls upon us to do the moſt, yet he puniſhes us not if we do it heartily and ſincerely, though with leſs paſſion and exactneſs. Now as Gods juſtice was ſecur'd in the impoſition of the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe whatever ſeverity was held over them to reſtrain their looſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, yet God exacted it onely by the meaſures of a man, and healed all their breaches by the medicine of Repentance: So now in the Goſpel he hath done it much more <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, God hath taken the vail off, and profeſs'd it openly, he hath included this mercy in the very conſtitution of the Covenant. For the Goſpel is the Covenant of Repentance; we ſhall not have leave to ſin, but we ſhall have leave to repent if we have ſinned: ſo that God hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a law of perfection, but he exacts it according to the poſſibilities of imperfect perſons,
<note place="margin">S. Auguſt. lib. 1. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract. c. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Omnia man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>data Dei facta deputantur, quando quicquid non fit, ignoſcitur,</hi> and then we have kept the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when we have received our pardon for what we have not kept.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> As the law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not of it ſelf im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible abſolutely and naturally: ſo neither are the Commandements of the Goſpel. For if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the particular of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, they were ſuch a burthen which the Jews themſelves were loth to part withall, becauſe it was <hi>in the Morall part of it</hi> but a law of abſtinence from evil; to which fear and temporal promiſes was, as they underſtood it, a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient endearment: But that burthen which neither <hi>they nor their fathers were able to bear,</hi> was the ſting of the law, that it allowed no repentance for great crimes,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.28.</note> but the tranſgreſſor ſhould die <hi>without mercy
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:115796:36"/>under two or three witneſſes.</hi> Now then ſince in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel there is no ſuch thing, but there is an allowance of repentance, this muſt needs be an eaſie yoke. This onely is to be added, That the righteouſneſs of the law was in abſtinence from evil; the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Goſpel is in that, and in the doing all the affirmative Commandements of Chriſt. Now this being a new obligation, brought alſo with it new abilities, I mean the glorious promiſes of the Goſpel, which whoſoever believes heartily, will finde himſelf able to do or ſuffer any thing for the enjoying of them; and this is that which is taught us by S. <hi>Paul: For what the law could not do,
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son,</hi> made it poſſible by the Spirit of Grace, and by our ſpirituall converſation.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> There is a Natural poſſibility, and a Moral: there are abilities in every man to do any thing that is there commanded, and he that can do well to day may do ſo to morrow; in the nature of things this is true: and ſince every ſin is a breach of a law which a man might and ought to have kept, it is naturally certain, that when ever any man did break the Commandement he might have done otherwiſe. In man therefore ſpeaking naturally and of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical poſſibilities of things, there is by thoſe aſſiſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are given in the Goſpel, ability to keep the Commandements Evangelical. But in the Moral ſenſe, that is, when we conſider what Man is, and what are his ſtrengths, and how many his enemies, and how ſoon he falls, and that he forgets when he ſhould remember, and his faculties are aſleep when they ſhould be awake, and he is hindred by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening accidents, and weakned and determin'd by ſuperinduc'd qualities, habits and neceſſities, the keeping of the Commandements is morally impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. Now that this may alſo be taken off, there is
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:115796:37"/>an abatement and an allowance made for this alſo. Our infirmities are pitied, our ignorances excuſed, our unavoidable errours not imputed. <hi>Theſe in the law were imputable,</hi> and it was lawful for the aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of blood to kill a Manſlayer who ſinn'd againſt his will, if he could overtake him before he got to Sanctuary. Theſe I ſay in the Law were <hi>imputable,</hi> but they were not <hi>imputed;</hi> Gods mercy took them off privately upon the accounts of his Mercy and a general Repentance: But in the Goſpel they are neither <hi>imputed,</hi> nor <hi>imputable:</hi> They were paid for beforehand, and put upon the accounts of the Croſs: <hi>God winked at the times of your ignorance;</hi> and, <hi>The Lord had pity on me, becauſe I did it in ignorance,</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and ſo <hi>Chriſt</hi> prayed, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. But ye did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly, as did alſo your Rulers;</hi> ſo S, <hi>Peter,</hi> and upon that account he called them to accept of mercy. And it is certain in reaſon, that if God forgives thoſe ſins of malice of which we repent, infinitely rather will he not impute what we cannot probably or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly avoid.

                  <p>But now to the ſecond inquiry:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Since in juſtice God exacts not an impoſſible law, how does it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt with his wiſdome to impoſe what in juſtice he does not exact? I anſwer, 1. That it was neceſſary the Law in its latitude and natural extenſion ſhould be given; for if in the ſanction any limits and leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenings had been deſcribed, it had been a permiſſion given to us to deſpiſe him in a certain degree, and could in no ſenſe have been proportionable to his infinity. God commands us to <hi>love him with all our hearts, and all our ſtrengths;</hi> that is, alwayes and with all that we can; if leſs then this had been impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and we commanded to love God but to a leſs, and a certain proportion, beſides that it would not have been poſſible for us to underſtand when we did what was commanded, it would have been either a direct leſſening our opinion of God, by tempting us to ſuppoſe no more love was due to him then ſuch a limited meaſure, or elſe a teaching us not to give him what was his due, either of which muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tend to Gods diſhonour.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> The <hi>commanding</hi> us to do all that we can, and that alwayes, though leſs be <hi>exacted,</hi> does invite our greateſt endevours, it entertains the faculties and labours of the beſt, and yet deſpiſes not the meaneſt, for they can endevour too, and they can do their beſt: and it ſerves the end of many graces beſides, and the honour of ſome of the Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> By this means ſtill we are contending and preſſing forwards; and no man can ſay he does now comprehend, or that his work is done, till he die; and therefore for ever he muſt grow in grace, which could not be without the propoſing of a Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, the performance of which would for ever ſufficiently imploy him: for by this means the Commandements do every day grow more poſſible
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:115796:38"/>then at firſt.
<note place="margin">In epiſtolâ ad Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centium dictum eſt, multos Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicos vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros dixiſſe poſſe homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem eſſe ſine peccato per gratiam Dei, non à nativitate ſed à con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſione.</note> A luſtful perſon thinks it impoſſible to mortifie his luſt: but when he hath long conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and got the maſtery, it grows eaſie, and at laſt in the progreſſions of a long piety, ſin is more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible then duty is. <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not, neither indeed can he;</hi> ſo S. <hi>John:</hi> and, <hi>Through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me I can do all things,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> It is long before a man comes to it, but the impoſſibility by degrees turns into a poſſibility, and that into an eaſineſs, and at laſt into a neceſſity. It is a trouble for ſome to commit a ſin. By this alſo we exerciſe a holy fear, and <hi>work out our ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi> It enlarges our care, and endears our watchfulneſs and caution. It cures or prevents our pride and bold challenges of God for rewards which we never can deſerve. It convinces us of the neceſſity of the Divine aid, and makes us to relie upon Gods goodneſs in helping us, and his mercy in pardoning us; and truly without this we could neither be ſo ſenſible of our infirmities, nor of the excellent gifts and mercies of God: for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God does not make neceſſities on purpoſe that he may ſerve them, or introduce ſin that he might pardon it, yet he loves we ſhould depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and by theſe rare arts of the Divine Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy make us to ſtrive to be like him, and in the midſt of our finite abilities have infinite deſires, that even ſo we may be diſpoſed towards the holineſs and glories of eternity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> Although God exacts not an impoſſible law under eternal and inſufferable pains, yet he impoſes great holineſs in unlimited and indefinite meaſures, with a deſign to give excellent proportions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward anſwerable to the greatneſs of our endeaovur. Hell is not the end of them that fail in the greateſt meaſures of perfection; but great degrees of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſhall be their portion who do all that they can
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:115796:38"/>alwayes, and offend in the feweſt inſtances. For as our duty is not limited, ſo neither are the degrees of glory: and if there were not this latitude of duty, neither could there be any difference in glory; neither could it be poſſible for all men to hope for heaven, but now all may: The meaneſt of Gods ſervants ſhall go thither, and yet there are greater meaſures for the beſt and moſt excellent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may underſtand that the impoſing of the Divine Laws in all the periods of the world,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> was highly conſiſtent with the Divine Juſtice, and an excellent, infinite wiſdome, and yet in the exacting them, Mercy prevail'd; becauſe the Covenant of Works or of exact obedience was never the rule of life and death, ſince the Saviour of the world was promiſed, that is, ſince the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> but all Mankinde was admitted to repentance, and waſh'd clean in the blood of the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſins of the world, and was ſlain from the beginning of it. Repentance was the meaſure of our duty, and the remedy for our evils; and the Commandements were not impoſſible to him that might amend what was done amiſs.</p>

For although every man be a ſinner, yet he that does not endevour to avoid all ſin, is not onely guilty of the ſin he commits, but the negligence alſo, which is the parent of the ſin, is another ſin, and directly criminal. So it is in the degrees of perfection, what we cannot attain to, we muſt at leaſt deſire. In this world we cannot arrive thither, but in this life we muſt alwayes be going thither.

But as a man may be an adulterer, or a thief, with his heart and his eye, as well as with his hand; ſo it is alſo in good things: A mans heart and eye may be in heaven, that is, in the ſtate of perfection, long before he ſets his feet upon the golden threſhold.

For they that

For as no man can on a ſudden become
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:115796:42"/>the worſt man in the world, his ſoul muſt by degrees be unſtript of holineſs, and then of modeſty, and then of all care of reputation, and then of diſuſe, and by theſe meaſures he will proceed to the conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the method of Hell and darkneſs: So can no man on a ſudden come to the right uſe of theſe graces. Not every man that dies in a good Cauſe ſhall have the reward of Martyrdome; but he that having liv'd well, ſeals that doctrine with dying, which before he adorn'd with living. And therefore it does infinitely concern all them that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in a good Cauſe, to take care that they be not prodigal of their ſufferings, and throw them away upon vice. Peeviſhneſs or pride, luſt or intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, can never be conſecrated by dying or by alms. But he that after a <hi>patient continuance in well doing,</hi> addes Charity or Martyrdome to the collective body of his other graces, he hath made them <hi>perfect</hi> with this kinde of <hi>perfection.</hi> Martyrdome can ſupply the place of actual baptiſms, but not of repentance: Becauſe without our fault it may ſo happen that the firſt cannot be had; but without our fault the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is never left undone.</p>
                  <p>Thus perfection and repentance may ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> Perfection does not ſuppoſe the higheſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of degrees in every one, but in all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their meaſures of grace and time. Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call perfection is ſuch as ſuppoſes a beginning, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant grace, progreſſion and variety, watchfulneſs and fear, trembling fear. And there are many gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces required of us, whoſe materiall and formal part is Repentance: Such as are <hi>Mortification, Peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſorrow, Spiritual mourning, Patience,</hi> ſome parts of <hi>Humility,</hi> all the parts and actions of <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and ſince in theſe alſo <hi>perfection</hi> is as great a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as in any thing elſe, it is certain that the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Chriſtian is not the ſupreme degree of action or intention.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:115796:43"/>
                  <p>But yet perfection cannot be leſs then an intire piety,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> a holineſs perfect in its parts, wanting no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing material, allowing no vicious habit, permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no vile action, but contending towards the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt excellency, a charitable heart, a ready hand, a confident Religion, willing to die when we are called to die, patient, conſtant and perſevering, endevou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <gap reason="foreign">

This is the ſumme of all thoſe ſeveral ſenſes of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection which are preſcrib'd in the ſeveral uſes of the word in holy Scripture. For though God through Jeſus Chriſt is pleaſed to abate for our unavoidable infirmities, that is, for our Nature, yet he will not abate or give allowance to our ſuperinduc'd evil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes; and the reaſon is plain for both, becauſe the one can be helped and the other cannot; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as to allow that is to be a patron of impiety, ſo not to allow for this, is to demand what cannot be done: that is againſt the holineſs, this againſt the goodneſs of God.</p>

This is the Precept of perfection, as it can conſiſt with the meaſures and infirmities of a man.</p>
                  <p>We muſt turn from all our evil wayes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> leaving no ſin unmortified, that's one meaſure of perfection, it is a <hi>perfect converſion.</hi> * We muſt have Charity; that's another perfection, it is <hi>a perfect grace.</hi> * We muſt be ready to part with all for a good conſcience, and to die for Chriſt; that's <hi>perfect obedience,</hi> and the moſt <hi>perfect love.</hi> * We muſt conform to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Will in doing and ſuffering, that's <hi>perfect pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience:</hi> we muſt <hi>live in all holy converſation and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs;</hi> that's <hi>a perfect ſtate.</hi> * We muſt ever be going forward and growing in godlineſs, that ſo we may be <hi>perfect men</hi> in Chriſt. * And we muſt perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere

                  <p n="1">1. THe Law is either taken for <hi>the Law of Moſes,</hi> or <hi>the Law of Works:</hi> The Law of Works is that Empire and Dominion which God exerciſed over man, uſing his utmoſt right, and obliging man to the rigorous obſervation of all that Law he ſhould impoſe upon him. And in this ſenſe, it was a Law of death, not of life, for no man could keep it, and they that did not, might not live. This was impos'd on <hi>Adam</hi> onely.</p>
                  <p>But when God brought <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he began to make a Covenant with them, with ſome compliance to their infirmities: For becauſe little things could not be avoided, Sacrifices were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their expiation; which was a <hi>mercy</hi> as the other was a <hi>miſery,</hi> a repentance as the ſin: But for great ſins there was no Sacrifice appointed, no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance miniſtred. And therefore ſtill we were in the miniſtration of death; for this mercy was not ſufficient, as yet it was not poſſible for a man to be juſtified by the Law. It threatned ſinners with death, it inflicted death, it did not promiſe eternal life, it miniſtred no grace, but fear and temporal hope: It was written in Tables of ſtone, not in their hearts; that is, the material parts of the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> was not conſonant to natural and eſſential reaſon, but arbitrary impoſitions; they were not perfective of a man, but very often deſtructive. This was a little alteration or eaſe of the Covenant of Works, but not enough.</p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="tcp:115796:46"/>
                  <p>From this ſtate of evil things we were freed by Chriſt;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The Law was called <hi>the letter, the miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death, the miniſtration of condemnation, the old Teſtament;</hi> apt to amaze and confound a ſinner, but did not give him any hopes of remiſſion, no glimpſe of heaven, no miniſtery of pardon: But the Goſpel is called, <hi>the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> the <hi>law of faith, the law of liberty;</hi> it miniſters repentance, it enjoyns holineſs, it gives life, and we all have hopes of being ſaved.</p>
                  <p>This which is the ſtate of things in which the whole world is repreſented in their ſeveral periods,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> is by <hi>ſome</hi> made to be the ſtate of every returning ſinner; and men are taught that they muſt paſs through the terrors of the Law, before they can receive the mercies of the Goſpel. The Law was a Schoolmaſter to bring the Synagogue to Chriſt; it was ſo to them who were under the Law, but it cannot be ſo to us, <hi>who are not under the law but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der grace.</hi> For if they mean <hi>the law of Works,</hi> or that impoſition which was the firſt entercourſe with man, they loſe their title to the mercies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; If they mean <hi>the law of Moſes,</hi> then they do not <hi>ſtand faſt in the liberty by which Chriſt hath made them free.</hi> But whatſoever the meaning be, neither of them can concern Chriſtians. For God hath ſent his Son to eſtabliſh a better Covenant in his blood, to preach repentance, to offer pardon, to condemn ſin in the fleſh, to publiſh the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to convince the world of ſin by his holy Spirit, to threaten damnation not to <hi>ſinners abſolutely,</hi> but <hi>abſolutely to the impenitent,</hi> and to promiſe and give ſalvation to his Sons and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The uſe that we Chriſtians are to make of the Law, is onely to magnifie the mercies of God in Jeſus Chriſt, who hath freed us from ſo ſevere a
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:115796:46"/>Covenant, who does not judge us by the meaſures of an Angel, but by the ſpan of a mans hand. But we are not to ſubject our ſelves ſo much as by fiction of law or fancy to the curſe and threatnings of the Covenant of Works, or of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, though it was of more inſtances and leſs ſeverity, by reaſon of the allowance of Sacrifices for expiation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Every Chriſtian man ſinning, is to conſider the horrible threatnings of the Goſpel, the ſevere intermination of eternal pains, the goodneſs of God leading to repentance, the ſeverity of his Juſtice in exacting great puniſhments of criminals, the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of this Juſtice puniſhing ſuch perſons into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably, who would not uſe ſo great a grace in ſo pleaſing a ſervice, for the purchaſe of ſo glorious a reward. The terrors of the Law did end in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral death, they could affright no further; but in the Goſpel Heaven and Hell were opened, and laid before all mankinde: and therefore by theſe meaſures a ſinner is to enter into the ſorrows of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and the care of his amendment. And it is ſo vain a thing to think every ſinner muſt in his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance paſs under the terrors of the Law, that this is a very deſtruction of that reaſon for which they are fallen upon the opinion. The Law is not enough to affright ſinners, and the terrors of the Goſpel are farre more to perſevering and impenitent ſinners, then the terrors of the Law were to the breakers of it. The cauſe of the miſtake is this: The Law was more terrible then the Goſpel is, becauſe it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed no mercy to the ſinner in great inſtances: But the Goſpel does. But then if we compare the ſtate of thoſe men who fell under the evils of the Law, with theſe who fall under the evils threatned in the Goſpel, we ſhall finde theſe to be in a worſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then thoſe by farre, as much as hell is worſe then being ſtoned to death, or thruſt through with
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:115796:47"/>a ſword. This we are taught by that excellent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Divine Epiſtle to the Hebrews,
<note place="margin">Heb. 10.28, 29.</note> 
                     <hi>He that deſpiſed Moſes law, died without mercy under two or three witneſſes: Of how much ſorer puniſhment ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ye ſhall he be thought worthy, who hath troden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was ſaenctified, an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the Spirit of Grace?</hi> So that, under the Goſpel, he that ſins and repents is in a farre better condition, then he that ſinn'd under the Law, and repented. For repentance was not then allowed of, the man was to die without mercy. But he that ſins and repents not, is under the Goſpel in a farre worſe condition then under the Law; for under the Goſpel, he ſhall have a farre ſorer puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then under the Law was threatned. Therefore let no man miſtake the mercies of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, or turn the grace of God into wantonneſs. The mercies of the Goſpel neither allow us to ſin, nor inflict an eaſier puniſhment; but they oblige us to more holineſs, under a greater penalty. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of which, I adde,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Covenant by which mankinde muſt now be judged, is a Covenant of more Mercy, but alſo of more holineſs: and therefore let no man think that now he is diſobliged from doing good works, by being admitted to the Covenant of Faith: For though the Covenants are oppos'd, as Old and New, as a worſe and a better, yet Faith and Works are not oppos'd. We are in the Goſpel tied to more, and to more excellent works then ever the ſubjects of any Law were; but if after a hearty endevour we fall into infirmity, and ſtill ſtrive againſt it, we are pitied here, but there we were not. Under the firſt Covenant, the Covenant of Works, no endevour was ſufficient, becauſe there was no allowance made for infirmities, no abatements for ignorance, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:115796:47"/>of exact meaſures, no conſideration of ſurpriſes, paſſions, folly, and inadvertency: but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Covenant our hearty endevour is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; but we are tied to endevour higher and more excellent things then they. But he that thinks this mercy gives him liberty to do what he pleaſe, loſes the mercy, and miſtakes the whole deſign and Oeconomy of Gods loving kindneſs.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> To every Chriſtian it is enjoyned that they be perfect; that is, according to the meaſure of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one. Which perfection conſiſts in doing our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour. He that does not do that, muſt never hope to be accepted, becauſe he refuſes to ſerve God by ſomething that is in his power. But he that does that, is ſure that God will not refuſe it, becauſe we cannot be dealt withall upon any other account, but by the meaſures of what is in our power; and for what is not, we cannot take care.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> To do our endevour, or our beſt, is not to be underſtood equally in all the periods of our life, according to the work or effect it ſelf, nor according to our natural powers, but it is accounted for by the general meaſures and great periods of our life. A man cannot pray alwayes with equal intention, nor give the ſame alms, nor equally mourn with ſharpneſs for his ſins. But God having appointed for every duty proper ſeaſons and ſolennities, hath declared, that <hi>He</hi> does his beſt, who heartily ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do the duty in its proper ſeaſon: But it were well we would remember that he that did a good act to day, can do the ſame to morrow in the ſame circumſtances; and he that yeſterday fought a noble battel and reſiſted valiantly, can upon the ſame terms contend as manfully every day, if he will conſider and watch. And though it will never be that men will <hi>alwayes</hi> do as well as <hi>at ſome times,</hi> yet when at any time they commit a ſin, it is not
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:115796:48"/>becauſe they could not, but becauſe they would not help it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> He that would be approved in doing his beſt, muſt omit no opportunity of doing a good action; becauſe when it is plac'd in its proper circumſtances, God layes his hand upon it, and calls to have it done, and there can be no excuſe for the omiſſion. He does not do his beſt, that does not do that, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a perſon does voluntarily omit the doing of a good, without juſt cauſe; and that cannot pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from an innocent principle.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> He that leaves any thing undone which he is commanded to do, or does what he is commanded to forbear, and conſiders or chooſes ſo to do, does not do his beſt, cannot plead his privilege in the Goſpel, but is fallen under the portion of ſinners, and will die, if he does not repent and make it up ſome way or other, by ſorrow, and a future dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> To ſin againſt our Conſcience can at no hand conſiſt with the duty of Chriſtian perfection; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loves not God with all his heart, nor ſerves him with all his ſtrength, who gives ſome of his ſtrength, and ſome of his affection to that which God forbids.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> No man muſt account that he does his duty, that is, his beſt, or according to the perfection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd of Chriſtians, but he that does better and better, and grows toward the meaſures of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt. For <hi>perfection</hi> is an infinite word; and it could not be communicated to ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of different capacities and degrees, but that there is ſomething common to them all which hath analogy and equivalent proportions. Now nothing can be <hi>perfect,</hi> but that to which nothing is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and therefore a man is not any way perfect but by doing all, all that he can; for then nothing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:115796:48"/>is wanting to him, when he hath put forth all his ſtrength. For perfection is not to be accounted by comparing the ſubjects which are perfect, for in that ſenſe nothing is perfect but God; but perfection is to be reckoned by every mans own proportions: For a body may be a perfect body, though it have not the perfection of a ſoul; and a man is perfect when he is heartily and intirely Gods ſervant, though he have not the perfection of S. <hi>Paul;</hi> as a man is a meek man, though he be not ſo meek as <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Chriſt.</hi> But he is not meek, if he keeps any fierceneſs or violence within. * But then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe to be <hi>more perfect</hi> is incident with humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he that does not endevour to get as much as he can, and more then he hath, he hath not the perfection of holy deſires. Therefore</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> Every perſon that is in the ſtate of grace, and deſigns to do his duty, muſt think of what is before him, not what is paſt; of the ſtages that are not yet run, not of thoſe little portions of his courſe he hath already finiſh'd.</p>

But ſome Commandements are propounded as to friends ſome as to ſervants; ſome under the threatning of horrible pains, others not ſo, but with the propoſition and under the invitation by glorious rewards. It was commanded to <hi>S. Paul</hi> to preach the Goſpel; if he had not obeyed, he ſhould have periſhed: <hi>Woe is me</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if I preach not the Goſpel:</hi> he was bound to do it. But he had another Commandment alſo, to <hi>love God</hi> as much as was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and <hi>to love his neighbour:</hi> which precepts were infinite, and of an unlimited ſignification, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were left to every ſervants choice to do them with his ſeveral meaſures of affection and zeal. <hi>He that did moſt,</hi> did the Commandement beſt; and therefore cannot be ſaid to do more then was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded;
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:115796:51"/>but <hi>he that does leſs;</hi> if he preaches the Goſpel, though with a leſs diligence, and fewer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, he obeys the Commandement, but not ſo nobly as the other. For example: God commands us to pray. He obeys this, that conſtantly and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voutly keeps his morning and evening Sacrifice, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering devoutly twice a day. He that prayes thrice a day, does better, and he that prayes ſeven times a day, hath done no work of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> but does what he does in purſuance of the Commandement. All the difference is in the manner of doing what is commanded; for no man can do more then he is commanded. But ſome do it better, ſome leſs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly; but all is comprehended under this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of <hi>loving God with all our hearts.</hi> When a father commands his children to come to him, he that comes ſlowly, obeyes the commandement, but he that runs does obey more willingly and readily: now though to come running was left to the choice of the childes affection, yet it was but a brisk purſuance of the commandement. Thus when he that is bound to pay Tithes, gives the beſt portion, or does it cheerfully, without contention, in all queſtions ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the worſe of the thing, and the better of the duty, does what he is commanded, and he does it with the affection of a ſon and of a friend, he loves his duty. <hi>Be angry, but ſin not:</hi> ſo it is in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; but he that to avoid the ſin, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour not to be angry at all, is the greater friend of God, by how much the further he ſtands off from ſin. Thus in all doubts to take the ſureſt ſide, to determine alwayes for Religion, when without ſin we might have determin'd for intereſt; to deny our ſelves in lawful things, to do all our duty by the meaſures of Love and of the Spirit, are inſtances of this filial obedience, and are rewarded by a <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:115796:51"/>Gods love to us, enabling us to call him <hi>Father,</hi> as well as <hi>Lord.</hi> Thus this Parable, or one like it is told in the book of <hi>Hermas. The Lord commanded his ſervant to put pales about his vineyard: He did ſo, and digg'd a ditch beſides, and rooted out all the weeds; which when his Lord obſerv'd, he made him co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir with his ſon.</hi> When S. <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> to give a free contribution to the poor Saints at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he invites to do it nobly &amp; cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, not as of conſtraint; for Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nam'd not the ſumme, neither can the degree of affection be nam'd; but yet God demands all our affection. Now in all the affirmative Precepts, the duty in the loweſt degree is that which is now made neceſſary under the loſs of all our hopes of Eternity; but all the further degrees of the ſame duty are impoſed upon the condition of greater rewards, and other collaterall advantages of duty.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Hyſtaſpes</hi> ask'd <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Perſian</hi> why he preferr'd <hi>Chryſantas</hi> before him,

                     </gap>, and is expreſſive of the whole duty of Repentance; and although it implies that ſorrow and grief which is the natural inlet of reformation of our lives, and the conſequent of our ſhame and ſin, yet it alſo does ſignify correction and amendment,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:115796:61"/>which is the formality and eſſence of Repentance; and therefore <hi>Eraſmus</hi> more warily and in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old Latines, ſayes that <hi>poenitere</hi> is from <hi>pone tenere, quod eſt poſterius conſilium ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pere;</hi> to be wiſer the next time; to chooſe again and chooſe better;
<note place="margin">Noct. Att. lib. 17. c. 1.</note> and ſo <hi>A.

So that here is both a <hi>Diſpleaſure</hi> and a <hi>Change;</hi> a diſpleaſure and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the evil, and a change to better. And there ought to be no ſcruple in this; for by the firſt ſorrow of a penitent man, is meant nothing elſe but the firſt act of eſchewing evil: which whether it be by grief alone, or by fear, or by hope, or by all theſe, it is not without ſome trouble of minde, and diſpleaſure; for if it were ſtill in all ſenſes a pleaſure to go on, they would never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn back. And therefore to ſuppoſe repentance without diſpleaſure, is to ſuppoſe a change of minde without alteration, or a taking a new courſe without diſliking the old. But then to ſuppoſe any other ſorrow naturally neceſſary, then this which naturally is included in the change, is to affirm that to be true which experience tels us is not true, and it is to place ſelf-affliction and punition at the head, which is to be look'd for in the retinue of repentance; to make the daughter to be before the Mother, and the fruit to be kept in the root, not to grow upon the branches. But the Latine words can no way determine any thing of Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion in this article; and the Greek words are uſed promiſcuouſly; and when they are diſtinguiſhed, they differ but as the more and leſs perfect, as
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:115796:61"/>the beginning of Repentance and the progreſs of perfection; according to that ſaying, <hi>Poenitentia erroris magnus gradus eſt ad reſipiſcentiam,</hi> To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge and be ſorry for our ſin is a great ſtep to repentance; and both together ſignify all that piety, that change, and holineſs which is the duty of the new man, of the Returning ſinner: and we can beſt learn it by the words of him that revealed and gave this grace to all his ſervants; even of the Holy Jeſus ſpeaking to S. <hi>Paul</hi> at his Converſion, from whoſe bleſſed words, together with thoſe of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his narrative of that ſtory, we may draw this more perfect deſcription. To repent is to <hi>turn from darkneſs to light,

                  <p>Upon this account,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> the parts of Repentance are two; 1. <hi>leaving our ſins:</hi> which is properly <hi>repentance from dead works.</hi> And 2. <hi>doing holy actions</hi> in the remaining portion of our dayes; <hi>actions meet for repentance;</hi> ſo the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> called them.

                  <p>For the preſent I conſider,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that Repentance or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:115796:64"/>Converſion admits of degrees according to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of men. For that Repentance which Chriſt and his Apoſtles preach'd at the opening of the Kingdome, was an univerſal change of life, which men did lead in the darkneſs of Heathen ignorance, and idolatrous impieties among the Gentiles, and the more then Heathen crimes among the Jews; the whole Nation being generally falſe, ſuperſtitious, bloody, perſecutors, proud, rebellious, and at laſt rejecters and crucifiers of their Meſſias, whom they had long'd for ever ſince they were a people: But in the perſwaſion and effecting of this Repentance, there was ſome difference of Diſpenſation and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> began,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> and he preach'd Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to the Jews, that <hi>they might believe</hi> in the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias, and <hi>ſo flee from the wrath to come,</hi> that is, from the deſtruction of their Nation, which he prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically foretold ſhould come to paſs for their reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him whom the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> did fore-ſignifie. Chriſt and his Apoſtles purſued the ſame Doctrine, ſtill thruſting forward the deſign, that is, preaching ſuch a Repentance as was proportionable to his purpoſe; that is, obedience to the Goſpel, the admiſſion of ſuch doctrines which did deſtroy the gayeties and curſed uſages of the world. So that the Repentance which was firſt preached was in order to Faith; that is, the Baptiſt, and Chriſt, and Chriſts Apoſtles preaching Repentance, did mean ſuch a converſion or change as would take them off from thoſe crimes which ſo prepoſſeſs'd their hearts, that by them they were indiſpos'd to receive Chriſts perſon and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, both which were ſo contrary to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices of Pride and Covetouſneſs, Malice and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</p>
                  <p>And therefore among the Jews,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Repentance was to go before Faith: for they were already ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:115796:65"/>diſpoſed to believe the Revelations of God, they had been uſed to Prophets, and expected the Meſſias, and pray'd for his day, and long'd paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately for it; ſo that they were by nothing hindred in their faith, but by their luſts and ſecular thoughts; and the way to make them believe, was to cure their pride.
<note place="margin">Joh. 5.44.</note> 
                     <hi>How can ye believe, who receive honour one of another?</hi> Their hunting after praiſe among the people, did indiſpoſe them to the believing and receiving Chriſts perſon and doctrine. Therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till they did repent of that, they could not believe; and accordingly our bleſſed Saviour complain'd, that when they ſaw the light which ſhin'd in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt, yet they would not repent, that they might believe.</hi> * But afterwards the Jews when they were invited to the Religion, that is, to believe in Jeſus, were firſt to be called to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe they had crucified the Lord of life: and if they ſhould not repent for crucifying an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon, they would be infinitely farre from believing him to be the Lord of life, and their long deſired Meſſias.</p>
                  <p>But the Repentance that was preached to the Gentiles,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> though it had the ſame deſign (as to the event of things) yet it went in another method. Their Religion taught them impiety, luſt and folly was plac'd upon their Altars, and their gods bore in their hands ſmoking firebrands kindled with the coals of <hi>Sodom:</hi> they had falſe confidences, and evil examples, and fooliſh principles; they had evil laws, and an abominable Prieſthood, and their <hi>Daemons,</hi> whom they call'd Gods, would be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with luſts and cruelty, with drunkenneſs and revellings; ſo that their falſe belief and evil Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion betrayed them to evil lives, therefore they were to be recovered by being taught a better belief, and a more holy Religion, therefore in theſe, faith was
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:115796:65"/>to go before Repentance. <hi>Poenitentiae ſtimulus ex fide acciderat,</hi> as <hi>Tertullians</hi> expreſſion is. Faith was the motive of their Repentance. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Repentance is the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and conſummation of Faith. For unleſs the ſinner believes his action to be a ſin, and that evil is his portion if he ſins, and that he ſhall be happy if he live by the rule of the Commandements, he can never be converted: Therefore in the converſion of the Gentiles, Faith was to be ordinarily the firſt.</p>
                  <p>In proportion to theſe ſeveral methods,

                  <p>And that,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.11, 12, 13.</note> knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of ſleep: for now is our ſalvation nearer then when we believed. * The night is farre ſpent, the day is at hand: <hi>let us therefore caſt off the works of darkneſs, and let us put on the armour of light.</hi> * Let us <hi>walk honeſtly as in the day,</hi> not in rioting and drunkenneſs, not in chambering and wantonneſs, not in ſtrife and envying. * But <hi>put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts thereof.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore theſe promiſes (dearly beloved) <hi>let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſs of the fleſh

                  <p>That ye put off,

                  <p>Let no man deceive you with vain words:
<note place="margin">Eph. 5.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 17.</note> for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of theſe things cometh the wrath of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of diſobedience. * Be not ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore partakers with them. * For ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord, <hi>walk as children of light.</hi> * For the fruit of the Spirit is <hi>in all goodneſs,</hi> and righteouſneſs, and truth. * Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what is acceptable unto the Lord: * And have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but rather reprove them. * See then that ye <hi>walk circumſpectly,</hi> not as fools, but as wiſe: * <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time,</hi> becauſe the dayes are evil. * Wherefore be ye not unwiſe, but underſtanding what the will of the Lord is.</p>

                  <p>For the grace of God that bringeth ſalvation,

                  </p>
                  <p>Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promiſes,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.</note> that by theſe you might be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the divine nature, having <hi>eſcaped the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption that is in the world through luſt. * And beſides this, giving all diligence, adde</hi> to your <hi>faith, vertue;</hi> and <hi>to vertue, knowledge;</hi> * And to knowledge, <hi>temperance;</hi> and to temperance, <hi>patience;</hi> and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, <hi>godlineſs;</hi> * And to godlineſs, <hi>brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> and to brotherly kindneſs, <hi>charity:</hi> * For if theſe things <hi>be in you</hi> and <hi>abound,</hi> they make you that ye ſhall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. * But <hi>he that lacketh theſe things is blinde,</hi> and cannot ſee farre off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old ſins.</p>

For beſides that we expound the Divine Laws to our own purpoſes of eaſe and ambition, we give to our ſins gentle cenſures, and adorn them with good words, and refuſe to load them with their proper characters and puniſhments, and at laſt are come to that ſtate of things, that ſince we cannot allow to our ſelves a liberty of doing every ſin, we have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed the Queſtion of ſins into ſeveral orders, and have taken one half to our ſelves. For we have found reſt to our fancies in the permiſſions of one whole kinde, having diſtinguiſhed ſins into <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial</hi> in their own nature; that is, ſins which
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:115796:77"/>may, and ſins which may not be done, without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; ſo that all the difference is, that ſome ſins muſt be taken heed of, but others there are, and they the moſt in number, and the moſt frequent in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and returns, which we have leave to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, without being affrighted with the fearful noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of damnation; by which doctrine, iniquity and confidence have much increaſed and grown upon the ruines and declenſion of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And this one Article hath almoſt an infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence to the diſparagement of Religion in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Caſes of Conſcience.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> For ſuppoſing the diſtinction to be believed, experience and certain reaſon will evince, that it is impoſſible to preſcribe proper limits and meaſures to the ſeveral kindes; and between the leaſt Mortal, and the greateſt Venial ſin, no man is able with certainty to diſtinguiſh: and therefore (as we ſee it daily happen, and in every page written by the Caſuiſts) men call what they pleaſe Venial, take what meaſures of them they like, appoint what expiation of them they fancy, and conſequently give what allowance they liſt to thoſe whom they pleaſe to miſlead. For in innumerable Caſes of Conſcience it is oftner inquired, whether a thing be <hi>Venial</hi> or <hi>Mortal,</hi> then whether it be <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> or not <hi>lawful;</hi> and as <hi>Purgatory</hi> is to <hi>Hell,</hi> ſo <hi>Venial</hi> is to <hi>Sin,</hi> a thing which men fear not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the main ſtake they think to be ſecured: for if they may have Heaven at laſt, they care not what comes between. And as many men of the Roman perſwaſion will rather chooſe <hi>Purgatory,</hi> then ſuffer here an inconſiderable penance, or do thoſe little ſervices which themſelves think will prevent it: ſo they chooſe venial ſins, and hug the pleaſures of trifles, warming themſelves at phantaſtick fires, and dancing in the light of the glo-worms; and they love them ſo well, that rather then quit thoſe little
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:115796:77"/>things, they will ſuffer the intolerable pains of a temporary Hell; for ſo they believe: which is the teſtimony of a great evil and a mighty danger; for it gives teſtimony, that little ſins can be beloved paſſionately, and therefore can miniſter ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light as is thought a price great enough to pay for the ſufferance of temporal evils, and Purgatory it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But the evil is worſe yet when it is reduc'd to practiſe.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For in the deciſion of very many queſtions, the anſwer is, <hi>It is a venial ſin;</hi> that is, though it be a ſin, yet there is in it no danger of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the favour of God by that, but you may do it, and you may do it again a thouſand thouſand times; and <hi>all the venial ſins</hi> of the world <hi>put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, can never do what one mortal ſin can,</hi> that is, make God to be your enemy:
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. de amiſſ. gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae cap. 13. §. alterum eſt.</note> So <hi>Bellarmine</hi> expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms. But becauſe there are many Doctors who write Caſes of Conſcience, and there is no meaſure to limit the parts of this diſtinction, (for that which is not at all cannot be meaſured) the Doctors differ infinitely in their ſentences; ſome calling that Mortal which others call Venial, (as you may ſee in the little Summaries of <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Emanuel Sà</hi>) the poor ſouls of the Laity, and the vulgar Clergy who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what is told them by the Authors or Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors they chooſe to follow, muſt needs be in infinite danger, and the whole body of Practical Divinity, in which the life of Religion and of all our hopes depends, ſhall be rendred dangerous and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and their confidence ſhall betray them unto death.</p>
                  <p>To bring relief to this ſtate of evil,

                     </q> So that the greatneſs of ſins is in moſt inſtances by extenſion and accumulation; that as he is a greater ſinner who ſins often in the ſame inſtance, then he that ſins ſeldome; ſo is he who ſins ſuch ſins as are complicated and intangled, like the twinings of combining Serpents. And this appears to be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe if we take ſingle ſins, as uncleanneſs and theft, no man can tell which is the greater ſin; neither can they be differenc'd but by ſomething that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the nature of the action it ſelf. A thought of theft, and an unclean thought, have nothing by which they can excel each other; but when you clothe them with the dreſs of active circumſtances, they grow greater or leſs reſpectively; becauſe then two or three ſins are put together, and get a new name.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> There is but one way more by which ſins can get or loſe degrees, and that is the different propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our affections. This indeed relates to God
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:115796:79"/>more immediately, and by him alone is judg'd; but the former being inveſted with material circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, can be judg'd by men: But all that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves for his own portion of the Sacrifice, is the Heart; that is, our love and choice; and therefore the degrees of love or hatred, is that meaſure by which God makes differing judgements of them. For by this it is, that little ſins become great, and great ſins become little. If a Jew had maliciouſly touch'd a dead body in the dayes of <hi>Eaſter,</hi> it had been a greater crime, then if in the violence of his temptation he had unwillingly will'd to commit an act of fornication. He that delights in little thefts, becauſe they are breaches of Gods Law, or burns a Prayer book, becauſe he hates Religion, is a greater criminal then he that falls into a material hereſie by an invincible or leſs diſcerned deception: Secure but to God your affections, and he will ſecure your innocence or pardon; for men live or die by their own meaſures. If a man ſpits in the face of a Prieſt to defie Religion, or ſhaves the beard of an Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to diſgrace the Prince (as it hapned to <hi>Davids</hi> Meſſengers) his ſin is greater then if he kill'd the Prieſt in his own juſt defence, or ſhot the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor through the heart, when he intended to ſtrike a Lion. For every negligence, every diſobedience being againſt Charity or the love of God, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation; this ſuperaddition of direct malice is open enmity againſt him, and therefore is more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely condemned by him who ſees every thought and degrees of paſſion and affection. For the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of malice does aggravate the ſin, juſt as the complication of material inſtances. Every degree of malice being as diſtinct and commenſurate a ſin, as any one external inſtance that hath a name; and therefore many degrees of malice combine and grow greater as many ſins conjoyn'd in one action,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:115796:80"/>they differ onely in Nature, not in Morality; juſt as a great number and a great weight: So that in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, all ſins are differenc'd by complication onely, that is, either of the external or the internal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> 
                     <hi>Though the negligence or the malice be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally equal, yet ſometimes by accident the ſins may be unequal, not onely in the account of men, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God too;</hi> but it is upon the account of both the former. It is when the material effect being diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent upon men, God hath with greater caution ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd ſuch intereſts. So that by interpretation the negligence is greater, becauſe the care was with greater earneſtneſs commanded; or elſe becauſe in ſuch caſes the ſin is complicated: for ſuch ſins which do moſt miſchief, have beſides their proper malignity, the evil of uncharitableneſs, or hating our brother. In ſome caſes God requires one hand, and in others both. Now he that puts but one of his fingers to each of them, his negligence is in nature the ſame, but not in value, becauſe where more is required, the defect was greater. If a man be equally careleſs of the life of his Neighbours Son and his Neighbours Cock, although the will or attendance to the action be naturally equal, that is, none at all, yet morally, and in the divine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they differ, becauſe the proportions of duty and obligation were different, and therefore more ought to have been put upon the one then upon the other: juſt as he is equally clothed that wears a ſingle garment in Summer and Winter, but he is not equally warm, unleſs he that wears a ſilk Mantle when the Dog-ſtar rages, claps on Furres when the cold North-ſtar changes the waters into rocks.</p>

And in this ſenſe is that ſaying of S. <hi>Baſil:

The difference of great and little ſins is no where to be found in the New Teſtament. One and the ſame ſentence is againſt all ſins; our Lord ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, He that doth ſin is the ſervant of ſin; and the word that I have ſpoken, that ſhall judge you in the laſt day; and John crieth out, ſaying, He that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to the Son, ſhall not ſee eternal life, but the wrath of God abideth on him: for this contumacy or diſobedience does not conſiſt in the difference of ſins, but in the violation of the Divine Law; and for that it is threatned with eternal pain.</hi> But beſides theſe Arguments from Scripture, he addes an excellent Reaſon: <hi>Prorſus autem ſi id nobis permittitur, ut

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> To abſtain from the fruit of a tree, not to gather ſticks or dew after a certain hour, not to touch the Curtains of the Ark, not to uncover our fathers ſhame, all is one as to God; for there is nothing in all our duty that can adde any moments to his felicity, but by what he pleaſe he is to try our obedience. Let no man therefore deſpiſe a ſin, or be bold to plead for it, as <hi>Lot</hi> for <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one?</hi> For no man can ſay it is little, if God hath choſen the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the ſin trangreſſes, as an inſtrument of his glorification and our felicity. Diſobedience is the formality of ſin; and ſince the inſtance or the matter of ſin is all one to God, ſo alſo is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. The reſult of this conſideration is this: 1. That no man ſhould indulge to himſelf the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt ſin, becauſe it is equally againſt God as the greateſt: and though accidentally it may come not to be ſo exacted, yet of it ſelf it may, and God is juſt if he does. 2. There is no ſin, but if God enters into judgement with us, he may juſtly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence us for it to the portion of accurſed Spirits. For if for any, then for all, there being (as to him)
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:115796:81"/>no difference. But theſe things are to be proved in the following Section.</p>

And ſince men uſually give this account, that God puniſhes a tranſient ſin with an immortal pain, becauſe though the action is finite, yet it was againſt an infinite God, we may upon the ſame ground eſteem it juſt, that even for the ſmalleſt ſin, God in the rigour of his juſtice can exact the biggeſt cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. For an act of Murther, or a whole year of Adultery, hath no nearer proportion to an eternity of pains, then one ſinful thought hath: for greater or leſs are no approaches towards infinite; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them both, and what is infinite, the diſtance is equally infinite.</p>

But God knows the hearts of men, their little obliquities and intricate turnings, every propenſity and ſecret purpoſe, what malice is ingredient, and what error is invincible, and how much is fit to be pitied, and therefore what may juſtly be exacted. For there are three ſeveral wayes of judgement according to the ſeveral capacities of the Judges. * Firſt, the laws of men judge onely by the event, or material action, and meddle not at all with the purpoſe, but where it is open'd by an active ſign. He that gives me a thouſand pounds to upbraid my poverty, or with a purpoſe to feed my crimes, is not puniſhable by law: but he is that takes from me a thouſand ſhillings, though ſecretly he means to give it to my needy brother. Becauſe as in the eſtimation of men no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is valuable but what does them good or hurt: ſo neither can their Laws and Tribunals receive teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of any thing but what is ſeen or felt.

Thoſe who preach ſevere doctrines to others, and touch them not with one of their fingers, are guilty of that which Chriſt reproved in the Phariſees; and themſelves ſhall be caſt-awayes, while they preach to others: ſo that the breaking it by diſobedience is damnable, as well as the breaking it by falſe interpretation:

Whatever there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may not be allowed to be taught, may not alſo be done; for the people are not to be taught evil, becauſe they muſt not do evil; but may the teachers do what they may not teach, and what the people may not do, or is not the ſame puniſhment to them both? 4. Now upon theſe grounds this very gloſs which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> gives being a falſe interpretation of theſe words of Chriſt (which are a ſummary of his whole Sermon, and as it were the ſanction and eſtabliſhment of the former and following periods into laws) muſt needs be of infinite danger to the inventer and followers of it: for this gloſs gives leave to men to break the leaſt of theſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>ſome way or other (if they do not teach others ſo to do)</hi> without being affrighted with fears of Hell; but in the mean while, this gloſs teaches, or gives leave to others to break them, but allows no falſe interpretation of them but its own. 5.

They were not ſins at all, if they were not againſt a Law, and if they be, they cannot be of their own nature venial, but muſt be liable to that puniſhment which was threatned in the Law whereof that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> The Law of God never threatens, the juſtice of God never inflicts puniſhment, but upon tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors of his Laws; the ſmalleſt offences are not only threatned, but may be puniſhed with death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are tranſgreſſions of the Divine Law. So S. <hi>Baſil</hi> argues; <hi>Nullum peccatum contemnendum ut parvum, quando D. Paulus de omni peccato gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratim pronunciaverat ſtimulum mortis eſſe peccatum; The ſting of death is ſin;</hi> that is, death is the evil conſequent of ſin, and comes in the tail of it; of every ſin, and therefore no ſin muſt be deſpiſed as if it were little. Now if every little ſin hath this ſting alſo (as it is on all hands agreed that it hath) it follows that every little tranſgreſſion is <hi>perfectly</hi> and intirely againſt a Commandement. And indeed it is not ſenſe to ſay any thing can in any ſenſe be a ſin, and that it ſhould not in the ſame ſenſe be againſt a Commandement. For although the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance be not named in the Law, yet every inſtance of that matter muſt be meant. It was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme

Indifferent</hi> I ſay in reſpect of that Law which relates to that particular matter, and <hi>indifferent</hi> in all ſenſes; unleſs there be ſome collateral Law which may prohibit it indirectly. So for a Judge to be a Coachman, for a Prieſt to be a Fidler or Inne-keeper, are not directly unlawful, but indirectly they are, as being againſt decency and publick honeſty or reputation, or being inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in order to that end whither their calling is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd. To this ſenſe are thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul, All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient;</hi> That is, ſome things which directly are lawful, by an indirect obligation may become unfit to be done; but otherwiſe, <hi>Licitum eſt quod nullâ lege prohibetur,</hi> ſaith the Law. If no Law forbids it, then it is lawful; and to abſtain from what is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful though it may have a worthineſs in it more then ordinary, yet to uſe our liberty is at no hand a ſin. The iſſue then is this; either we are forbidden to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:115796:87"/>doe a venial ſin, or we are not. If we are not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, then it is as lawful to doe a venial ſin as to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or eat fleſh: If we are forbidden, then every ſuch action is directly againſt Gods Law, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently finable at the will of the ſupreme Judge, and if he pleaſe, puniſhable with a ſupreme anger.

                     <hi>Every ſin, even the ſmalleſt, is againſt Charity,</hi> which is the end of the Commandement. For every ſin or evil of tranſgreſſion is far worſe then all the evils of puniſhment with which mankinde is affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in this world; and it is a leſs evil that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde ſhould be deſtroyed, then that God ſhould be diſpleaſed in the leaſt inſtance that is imaginable. Now if we eſteem the loſs of our life or our eſtate, the wounding our head, or the extinction of an eye to be great evils to us, and him that does any thing of this to us, to be our enemy, or to be injurious, we are to remember that God hates every ſin worſe, then we can hate pain or beggery. And if a nice and a tender conſcience, the ſpirit of every excellent perſon does extremely hate all that can provoke God to anger or to jealouſy; it muſt be certain that God hates every ſuch thing with an hatred infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:115796:88"/>greater, ſo great that no underſtanding can perceive the vaſtneſs of it and immenſity. For by how much every one is better, by ſo much the more he hates every ſin; and the ſoul of a righteous man is vexed and afflicted with the inrodes of his una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable calamities, the armies of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the lice and flies, his inſinuating, creeping infirmities: Now if it be holineſs in him to hate theſe little ſins, it is an imitation of God; for what is in us by derivation, is in God eſſentially; therefore that which angers a good man, and ought ſo to do, diſpleaſes God, and conſequently is againſt charity or the love of God. For it is but a vain dream to imagine, that becauſe juſt men, ſuch who are in the ſtate of grace, and of the love of God, do commit ſmaller offences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are not againſt the love of God; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of cold does abate ſomething of the heat in any hot body; but yet becauſe it cannot deſtroy it all, cold and heat may be conſiſtent in the ſame ſubject; but no man can therefore ſay, they are not contraries, and would not deſtroy each other if they were not hindred by ſomething elſe; and ſo would the ſmalleſt offences alſo deſtroy the life of grace, if they were not deſtroyed themſelves. But of this afterwards. For the preſent, let it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, how it can poſſibly conſiſt with our love to God, with that duty that commands us to love him with all our heart, with all our ſtrength, with all our might, and with all our ſoul, how (I ſay) it can be conſiſtent with a love ſo extended, ſo intended, to entertain any thing that he hates ſo eſſentially. To theſe particulars I adde this one conſideration; That ſince there is in the world a fierce opinion, that ſome ſins are ſo ſlight and little, that they doe not deſtroy our relation to God, and cannot break the ſacred tie of friendſhip, he who upon the inference and preſumption of that opinion ſhall chooſe to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:115796:88"/>commit ſuch ſmall ſins, which he thinks to be the <hi>All</hi> that is permitted him, is not excuſed by that ſuppoſition: For if it be ſaid that he is therefore ſuppoſed to love God, becauſe he onely does thoſe little ſins which he thinks are not againſt the love of God, and if he did not think ſo, he would not do them; This excuſes him not, but aggravates the ſin, for it is turning the grace of God into wantonneſs. For ſince that ſuch little things are the eaſier par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, is wholly owing to Gods grace and his ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar goodneſs, he that abuſes this goodneſs to licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, makes his ſin to abound, becauſe Gods grace abounds; becauſe God is good, he takes leave to do evil, that is, to be moſt contrary to God. For it is certain that every man in this caſe, hath affections for ſin as formerly; indeed he entertains it not in the ruder inſtances becauſe he dares not, but he does all that he dares doe; for when he is taught that ſome certain ſins are not damnable, there he will not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain: which is a demonſtration that though he does ſomething for fear, yet he does nothing for love.</p>

Some others there are who out of a ſincere but an abuſed Conſcience perſecute a good cauſe; theſe men are zealous for God, and yet fight againſt him: But becauſe theſe are real enemies, and but ſuppoſed friends, therefore by interpretation and in effect they turn from God and turn to the Creature.

He that prefers pleaſure or profit before his duty, rejects God, but loves money, and payes his devotion to intereſt or eaſe, or ſenſuality. And juſt ſo does the ſmalleſt ſin.

He that tells a lie to promote Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, or to ſave the life of a man, or to convert his ſoul, does not tell that lie for God, but tells the lie to make way for ſomething elſe which is in order to God; he breaks his legs, that he may the better walk in the path of the Divine Commandements.

                  <p>And it is not to be neglected,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> that the ſmaller the ſin is, the leſs it is excuſable if it be done when it is obſerved. For if it be ſmall, is it not the ſooner obeyed, and the more reaſonably exacted, and the more bountifully repaid, when Heaven is given as the price of ſo ſmall a ſervice? He that purſues his crime for a mighty purchaſe, to get a Kingdome, or a vaſt eſtate, or an exquiſite beauty, or ſomething that is bigger then the ordinary vertues of eaſie and common men, hath ſomething (not to warrant and legitimate, but) to extenuate the offence by great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the temptation. But to loſe the friendſhip of God for a Nut-ſhell, to ſave ſix pence, to loſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with peeviſhneſs, to deſpiſe the Divine Laws for a non-ſenſe inſignificant vapour, and a teſty pride hath no excuſe, but it loads the ſinner with the diſreputation of a mighty folly. What excuſe can be made for him that will not ſo much as hold his peace to pleaſe God? What can he do leſs for him? How ſhould it be expected he ſhould mortifie his luſts, deny his ambition, part with his goods, loſe an eye cut off a hand, give his life for God, when he will not for God loſe the no pleaſure of talking vainly, and proudly, and ridiculouſly? If he will not chaſtiſe his wanton thoughts to pleaſe God how ſhall he throw out his whole body of luſt? If he will not reſiſt the trifling temptations of a drinking friend to preſerve his temperance, how ſhall he chooſe to be baniſhed or murther'd by the rage of a drunken Prince, rather then keep the circle in their giddy and vertiginous method? The leſs the inſtance be, the direct averſation from God is alſo moſt commonly the leſs; but in many caſes the averſation is by interpretation greater, more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, and therefore leſs excuſable; as when the ſmall inſtance is choſen by a perfect &amp; diſtinct act of election; as it is in thoſe who out of fear of Hell quit
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:115796:90"/>the acting of their clamorous ſins, and yet keep the affections to them, and conſequently entertain them in thoughts and little reflexions, in remembrances and phantaſtick images.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> But if we reduce this Queſtion a little nearer to practiſe and clothe it with circumſtances, we ſhall finde this account to be ſadder then is uſually ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd. But before I inſtance in the particulars, I ſhall premiſe this diſtinction of venial ſins, which is neceſſary not onely for the conducting of this Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, but our Conſciences alſo in this whole Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The Roman Schools ſay, that ſins are Venial either by the imperfection of the agent, as when a thing is done ignorantly, or by ſurpriſe, or inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: or 2. A ſin is Venial by the ſmalneſs of the matter; as if a man ſteals a farthing, or eats a little too greedily at his meal, or lies in bed half an hour longer then would become him: or 3. A ſin (ſay they) is Venial in its whole kinde, that is, ſuch which God cannot by the nature of the thing puniſh with the higheſt puniſhment; ſuch as are idle words and the like. Now firſt, I ſuppoſe that the two latter will be found to be both one: For either God hath not forbidden idleneſs or falſneſs, or he hath made no reſtraint at all upon words, but left us at liberty to talk as we pleaſe; for if he hath in this caſe made a law, then idle words either cannot pretend to an excuſe, or it muſt be for the ſmalneſs of the matter; or elſe it muſt fall in with the firſt, and be excuſed, becauſe they cannot alwayes be attended to.</p>
                  <p>Now concerning the firſt ſort of <hi>venial ſins,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> it is not a kinde of ſins, but a manner of making all ſins <hi>venial,</hi> (that is) <hi>apt for pardon:</hi> for by the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the agent or the act, all great ſins in their matter, may become little in their malice and guilt. Now theſe are thoſe which Divines call <hi>ſins of infirmity;</hi> and of them I ſhall give an account
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:115796:90"/>in a diſtinct Chapter, under that title.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the ſecond,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> 
                     <hi>i. e. ſins venial for the ſmalneſs of the matter;</hi> I know none ſuch. For if the matter be a <hi>particular</hi> that God hath expreſly commanded or forbidden reſpectively, it is not lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, but all one to him as that which we call the greateſt. But if the particular be wholly relating to our neighbour, the ſmalneſs of the matter does not abſolutely make the ſin venial: for amongſt us no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is abſolutely great, or abſolutely little, but in compariſon with ſomething elſe; and if a vile per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had robb'd the poor woman that offered two mites to the treaſury of the Temple, he had undone her; a farthing there was all her ſubſtance: ſo that the ſmalneſs of the matter is not directly an excuſe. If a man had robb'd a <hi>rich man</hi> of a farthing, he had not indeed done him ſo great a miſchief: but how if the rich man was not willing to part with his far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but would be angry at the injury, is it not a ſin, becauſe the theft was ſmall? No man queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons but it is. It follows therefore that the ſmalneſs of the matter cannot make a ſin venial, but where there is a leave expreſly given, or juſtly preſumed: and if it be ſo in a great matter, it is as little a ſin as if the matter were ſmall, that is, none at all.</p>
                  <p>But now concerning the third,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> which the Roman Schools dream of, <hi>ſins venial in their own nature,</hi> and in their whole kinde; that is it which I have been diſputing againſt all this while, and ſhall now further conclude againſt by arguments more practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and moral. For if we conſider what are thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars which theſe men call venial ſins in their whole kinde and nature, we ſhall finde that Chriſt and they give meaſures differing from each other. The Catalogues of them I will take from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, not that they ever thought theſe things to be in their nature venial, (for they that think ſo of
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:115796:91"/>them are ſtrangers to their writings: and to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath not brought one teſtimony pertinent and home to the queſtion:) but becauſe they reckon ſuch Catalogues of venial ſins, which demonſtrate that they do mean ſins made venial by <hi>accident,</hi> by mens <hi>infirmity,</hi> by <hi>Gods grace,</hi> by <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> by <hi>repentance,</hi> and not ſuch which are ſo in their own nature.

                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> When God appointed in the Law expiatory Sacrifices for ſins, although there was enough to ſignifie that there is difference in the degrees of ſin, yet becauſe they were <hi>eodem ſanguine eluenda,</hi> and <hi>without ſhedding of blood there was no remiſſion,</hi> they were reckon'd in the ſame accounts of death and the Divine anger.

<note n="b" place="margin">Bellar. de amiſſ. gra. lib. 1. c. 14. §.

Well! yet let it be conſidered, whether or no do not the ſmalleſt unremitted ſins, in creaſe the torments of hell in their proportion? If they doe not, then they are not at all puniſhed in hell; for if without them the periſhing ſoul is equally puniſhed, then for them there is no puniſhment at all. But if they doe increaſe the pains, as it is certain they doe, then to them properly, and for their own malignity and demerit, a portion of eternal pains is aſſigned. Now if God puniſhes them in hell, then they deſerv'd hell; if they be damnable in their event, then they were ſo in their merit; for God never puniſhes any ſin more then it deſerves, though he often does leſs. But to ſay that this is by accident, that is, for their conjunction with mortal ſins, is confuted infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, becauſe God puniſhes them with degrees of evil proper to them, and for their own demerit; There is no other accident by which theſe come to be ſmarted for in hell, but becauſe they were not repented of; for by that accident they become <hi>Mortal;</hi> as by the contrary accident, to wit, if the

But if the man be a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy penitent, if he continues and abides in Gods love, he will finde a mercy according to his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by the meaſures of Gods graciouſneſs, and his own repentance: ſo that by accident they may be pardoned, but if that accident does not happen, if the man be not penitent, the ſins ſhall be puniſhed directly, and for their own natural demerit. The ſumme is this.</p>
                  <p>If a man repents truly of the greater ſins, he alſo repents of the ſmalleſt; for it cannot be a true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which refuſes to repent of any; ſo that if it happens that for the ſmalleſt he doe ſmart in hell, it is becauſe he did not repent truly of any, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, nor ſmalleſt.

                  <p>I Have been the more earneſt in this article,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> not onely becauſe the Doctrine which I have all this while oppoſed makes all the whole doctrine of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Theology to be inartificial, and in many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees uſeleſs, falſe and imprudent; but becauſe of the immediate influence it hath to encourage evil lives of men. For,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> To diſtinguiſh a whole kinde of ſins is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way to mak repentance and amendment of life imperfect and falſe. For when men by fears and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible conſiderations are ſcar'd from their ſins, as moſt repentances begin with fear, they ſtill retain ſome portions of affection to their ſin, ſome look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings back and phantaſtick entertainments, which if they be not par'd off by repentance, we love not God with all our hearts; and yet by this doctrine of diſtinguiſhing ſins into Mortal and Venial in their whole kinde and nature, men are taught to arreſt their repentances, and have leave not to proceed further: for they who ſay ſins are Venial in their own nature, if they underſtand the conſequences of their own doctrine, do not require repentance to make them ſo, or to obtain a pardon which they need not.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> As by this means our repentances are made imperfect, ſo is a relapſe extremely ready; for while ſuch a leaven is left, it is ten to one but it may ſowre the whole maſs. S. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaid well,

                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> But it is worſe yet. For the diſtinction of ſins <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Venial in their nature</hi> is ſuch a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of ſin from ſin, as is rather a diſpenſation or leave to commit one ſort of them; the expiation of which is ſo eaſy, the pardon ſo certain, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy ſo ready, the obſervation and exaction of them ſo inconſiderable. For there being ſo many ways of making great ſins little, and little ſins none at all, found out by the folly of men and the craft of the Devil, a great portion of Gods right, and the duty we owe to him, is by way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe and agreement left as a portion to careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly: and why may not a man rejoyce in thoſe trifling ſins, for which he hath ſecurity he ſhall never be damned? As for the device of Purgatory, indeed if there were any ſuch thing, it were enough to ſcare any one from committing any ſins, much more little ones. But I have converſed with many of that perſwaſion, and yet never obſerved any to whom it was a terror to ſpeak of Purgatory, but would talk of it as an antidote or ſecurity againſt hell, but not as a formidable ſtory to affright them from their ſins, but to warrant their venial ſins, and their imperfect repentance for their mortal ſins. And indeed let it be conſidered: If venial ſins be ſuch as the Romane DD. deſcribe them; that <hi>they neither deſtroy nor leſſen charity</hi> or the grace of God, that <hi>they onely hinder the fervency of an act,</hi> which ſleep or buſineſs, or any thing that is moſt innocent may doe; that <hi>they are not againſt the law, but beſides it;</hi> as walking and riding, ſtanding and ſitting are; that they are not properly ſins, that <hi>all the venial ſins in the world cannot amount to one mortal ſin,</hi> but as <hi>time differs from eternity,</hi> as finite from infinite, ſo doe all the Venial ſins in the world put together, from
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:115796:95"/>one Mortal act; that for all them a man is never the leſs beloved, and loves God nothing the leſs; I ſay if venial ſins be ſuch (as the Roman Writers affirm they are) how can it be imagined to be agreeable to Gods goodneſs to inflict upon ſuch ſinners who onely have venial ſins unſatisfied for, ſuch horrible pains (which they dream of in Purgatory) as are, during their abode, equal to the intolerable pains of hell, for that which breaks none of his laws, which angers him not, which is not againſt him or his love, which is incident to his deareſt ſervants? <hi>Pro peccato magno paulum ſupplicii ſat is eſt patri;</hi> But if fathers take ſuch ſevere amends of their children for that which is not properly ſin, there is nothing left by which we can boaſt of a fathers kindneſs. In this caſe, there is no remiſſion; for if it be not juſt in God to puniſh ſuch ſins in hel, becauſe they are conſiſtent with the ſtate of the love of God, and yet they are puniſhed in Purgatory, that is, as much as they can be puniſhed; then God does remit to his children nothing for their loves ſake, but deals with them as ſeverely as for his juſtice he can, in the matter of venial ſins; indeed if he uſes mercy to them at all, it is in remitting their mortal ſins, but in their venial ſins he uſes none at all. Now if things were thus on both ſides, it is ſtrange, men are not more afraid of their venial ſins, and that they are not more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in their deſcription, which are ſo ſad in their event; and that their puniſhment ſhould be ſo great, when their malice is ſo none at all; and it is ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt of all, that if men did believe ſuch horrible ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to be the conſequent of venial ſins, they ſhould eſteem them little, and inconſiderable, and warn men of them with ſo little caution. But to take this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der off, though they affright men with Purgatory at the end, yet they make the bugbear nothing by their eaſy remedies and preventions in the way.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:115796:96"/>Venial ſins may be taken off (according to their doctrine) at as cheap a rate as they may be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; but of this I ſhall give a fuller account in the 6. §. of this Chapter. In the mean time, to believe Purgatory, ſerves the ends of the Roman Clergy, and to have ſo much eaſineſs and leave in venial ſins, ſerves the ends of their Laity; but as truth is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd in the former, ſo is piety and the ſeverities of a holy life very much ſlackned by the latter.</p>
                  <p>But as care is taken that <hi>their</hi> doctrine doe not deſtroy charity or good life by looſneſs and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> ſo care muſt be taken that ours doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy hope, and diſcountenance the endevours of pious people; for if the ſmalleſt ſins be ſo highly puniſhable, who can hope ever to eſcape the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſtate of damnation? And if God can be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally angry for thoſe things which we account ſmall ſins, then no man is a ſervant or a friend of God; no man is in the ſtate of the Divine favour; for no man is without theſe ſins; for they are ſuch,
<q>Quae non poſſit homo quiſquam evitare cavendo,</q> a man by all his induſtry cannot wholly avoid. Now becauſe the Scripture pronounces ſome perſons juſt and righteous, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Joſiah, Zechary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who yet could not be innocent and pure from ſmall offences: either theſe little things are in their own nature venial, or the godly have leave to doe that, which is puniſhed in the ungodly, or ſome other way muſt be found out, how that which is in its own nature damnable, can ſtand with the ſtate of grace; and upon what cauſes, ſins which of themſelves are not ſo, may come to be venial, that is, more apt and ready to be pardoned, and in the next diſpoſitions to receive a mercy.</p>

He that loves to caſt over in his minde the pleaſures of his paſt ſin, he that entertains all thoſe inſtances of ſin, which he thinks not to be damnable, this man hath given himſelf up to be a ſervant to a trifle, a lover of little and phantaſtick pleaſures. Nothing of this can ſtand with the ſtate of grace. No man can love ſin and love God at the ſame time; and to think it to be an excuſe to ſay the ſin is little, is as if an adultereſs ſhould hope for pardon of her offended Lord, becauſe the man whom ſhe dotes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an inconſiderable perſon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> In ſins we muſt diſtinguiſh the formality from the material part.

The firſt can never happen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our will; but the latter may by ſurpriſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliberation, and imperfection of condition. For in this life our underſtanding is weak, our attention trifling, our advertency interrupted, our diverſions many, our diviſions of ſpirit irreſiſtible, our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge little, our dulneſs frequent, our miſtakes many, our fears potent, and betrayers of our reaſon; and at any one of theſe doors ſin may enter, in its mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial part, while the will is unactive, or the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding

Let no man therefore ſay, I have a deſire to pleaſe my ſelf in ſome little things; for if he deſires it, he may not do it, that very deſire makes that it cannot be venial, but as damnable as any, in its proportion.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:115796:98"/>ſo it puts on its degrees of veniality, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pardonoble.

For a ſin is venial upon no other account but of Repentance. If <hi>Venial</hi> be taken for <hi>pardonable,</hi> it is true that many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make it ſo, more or leſs; that is, whatever makes the ſin greater or leſs, makes it more or leſs venial: and of theſe I ſhall give account in the chapter of <hi>ſins of Infirmity.</hi> But if by <hi>Venial.</hi> we mean actually pardon'd, or not exacted: Nothing makes a ſin <hi>venial,</hi> but Repentance, and that makes every ſin to be ſo. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> Some ſins are admitted by holy perſons, and yet they ſtill continue holy; not that any of theſe ſins is permitted to them; nor that God cannot as juſtly exact them of his ſervants as of his enemies; nor that in the Covenant of the Goſpel they are not imputable; nor that their being in Gods favour hides them, for God is moſt impatient of any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining evil in his children: But the onely reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account of it is, becauſe the ſtate of grace is a ſtate of Repentance; theſe ſins are thoſe which as <hi>Pacianus</hi> expreſſes it, <hi>contrariis emendata proficiunt,</hi> they can be helped by contrary actions: and the good man does perpetually watch againſt them, he oppoſes a good againſt every every evil; that is, in effect he uſes them juſt as he uſes the greateſt that ever he committed. Thus the good man when he reproves a ſinning perſon over-acts his anger, and is tranſported to undecency, though it be for God:
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:115796:98"/>Some are over zealous, ſome are phantaſtick and too apt to opinion, which in little degrees of inordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not ſo ſoon diſcernible. A good man may be over-joyed, or too much pleas'd with his recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or be too paſſionate at the death of a childe, or in a ſudden anger go beyond the evenneſs of a wiſe Chriſtian, and yet be a good man ſtill, and a friend of God, his ſon and his ſervant: but then theſe things happen in deſpite of all his care and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and when he does eſpy any of theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquities, he is troubled at it, and ſeeks to amend it: and therefore theſe things are venial, that is, pitied and excuſed, becauſe they are unavoidable, but avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as much as they well can (all things conſidered) and God does not exact them of him, becauſe the good man exacts them of himſelf. * <hi>Theſe being the Rules of Doctrine, we are to practiſe accordingly.</hi>

                  <p>To which adde the following meaſures.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> This difference in ſins, of <hi>Mortal</hi> and <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial,</hi> that is, greater and leſs, is not to be conſidered by us, but by God alone, and cannot have influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon us to any good purpoſes. For 1. We do not alwayes know by what particular meaſures they are leſſened: In general we know ſome proportions of them, but when we come to particulars, we may eaſily be deceived, but can very hardly be exact. S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid the ſame thing. <hi>Quae ſint levia,
<note place="margin">Enchirid, cap. 78.</note> &amp; quae gravia peccata, non humano ſed Divino ſunt penſanda judicio.</hi> God onely, not man, can tell which ſins are great, and which little. For ſince we ſee them equally forbidden, we muſt with equal care avoid them all. Indeed if the caſe ſhould be ſo put, that we muſt either commit Sacrilege, or tell a ſpiteful lie, kill a man, or ſpeak unclean words, then it might be of uſe to us to conſider which is the greater, which is
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:115796:99"/>leſs, that, <hi>of evils we might chooſe the leſs:</hi> but this eaſe can never be, for no man is ever brought to that neceſſity that he muſt chooſe one ſin; for he can chooſe to die before he ſhall do either, and that's the worſt that he can be put to. And therefore though right reaſon and experience, and ſome gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral lines of Religion mark out ſome actions as crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and leave others under a general and indefinite condemnation, yet it is in order to repentance and amends when ſuch things are done, not to greater caution directly of avoiding them in the dayes of temptation; for of two infinites in the ſame kinde, one cannot be bigger then the other. We are tied with the biggeſt care to avoid every ſin, and bigger then the biggeſt we finde not This onely: For the avoiding of the greateſt ſins, there are more argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from without, and ſometimes more inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and miniſteries of caution and prevention are to be uſed, then in leſſer ſins; but it is becauſe fewer will ſerve in one then in another; but all that is needful muſt be uſed in all, but there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in our choice that can be conſiderable, for we muſt never chooſe either, and therefore beforehand to compare them together, whereof neither is to be preferred before the other is to lay a ſnare for our ſelves, and make us apt to one by undervaluing it, and calling it leſs then others, that affright us more. Indeed when the ſin is done, to meaſure it may be of uſe (as I ſhall ſhew) but to do it beforehand hath danger in it of being tempted, and more then a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being deceived. For our hearts deceive us, our purpoſes are complicated, and we know not which end is principally intended, nor by what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument amongſt many, we were finally determin'd, or which is the prevailing ingredient; nor are we competent Judges of our own ſtrengths, and we can do more then we think we can; and we remember
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:115796:99"/>not, that the temptation which prevails was ſought for by our ſelves; nor can we ſeparate neceſſity from choice, our conſent from our being betrayed; nor tell whether our fort is given up, becauſe we would do ſo, or becauſe we could not help it. Who can tell whether he could not ſtand one aſſault more, and if he had, whether or no the temptation would not have left him? The wayes of conſent are not alwayes direct, and if they be crooked, we ſee them not. And after all this, if we were able, yet we are not willing to judge right, with truth, and with ſeverity: ſomething for our ſelves, ſomething for excuſe, ſomething for pride; a little for vanity, and a little in hypocriſie, but a great deal for peace and quiet, that the reſt of the minde may not be diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, that we may live and die in peace, and in a good opinion of our ſelves. Theſe indeed are evil mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but ſuch by which we uſually make judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our actions, and are therefore likely to call great ſins little, and little ſins none at all. **</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> That any ſins are venial being onely becauſe of the ſtate of grace and Repentance, under which they are admitted; what condition a man is in, even for the ſmalleſt ſins, he can no more know then he can tell that all his other ſins are pardon'd, that his Repentance is accepted, that nothing of Gods anger is reſerved, that he is pleaſed for all, that there is no Judgement behinde hanging over his head, to ſtrike him for that wherein he was moſt negligent. Now although ſome men have great and juſt confidences that they are actually in Gods favour, yet all good men have not ſo. For there are coverings ſometimes put over the ſpirits of the beſt men; and there are intermedial and doubtful ſtates of men, (as I ſhall repreſent in the Chapter of <hi>Actuall ſins</hi>) there are alſo ebbings and flowings of ſin and pardon: and therefore none
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:115796:100"/>but God onely knows how long this ſtate of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niality and pardon will laſt; and therefore as no man can pronounce concerning any kinde of ſins, that they are in themſelves venial, ſo neither can he know concerning his own, or any mans particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſtate, that any ſuch ſins are pardon'd, or <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial</hi> to him. He that lives a good life will finde it ſo in its own caſe, and in the event of things; and that's all which can be ſaid as to his particular: and it is well it is ſo, <hi>ne ſtudium proficiendi ad omnia peccata cavenda pigreſcat</hi> (as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> well obſerved.) If it were otherwiſe, and that ſins in their own nature by venial and not venial are diſtinguiſhed and ſeparate in their natures from each other, and that ſome of them are of ſo eaſie remedy, and inconſiderable a guilt, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver become earneſt to avoid all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> There are ſome ſins which indeed ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, and were they not ſentenc'd in Scripture with ſevere words would paſs for trifles; but <hi>in Scripturis demonſtrantur opinione graviora</hi> (as S.

S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I had not known concupiſcence to be a ſin, if the law had not ſaid, Thou ſhalt not luſt:</hi> and we uſe to call them ſcrupulous and phantaſtick perſons who make much adoe about a careleſs word, and call themſelves to ſevere account for every thought, and are troubled for every morſel they eat, when it can be diſputed whether it might not better have been ſpared. Who could have gueſſed that calling my enemy <hi>Fool</hi> ſhould be ſo great a matter; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are told that it is ſo; told by him that ſhall be our Judge, who ſhall call us to account for every idle word; we may well think that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:115796:100"/>which men uſually make by their cuſtomes and falſe principles, and their own neceſſities, leſt they by themſelves ſhould be condemned, are weak and fallacious: and therefore whatſoever can be of truth in the difference of ſins, may become a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to them who deſire to diſtinguiſh them, but can bring no advantages to the intereſts of piety and a holy life.</p>

If he thinks ſo, it will be very uneaſy for him to keep it: but if he will keep it, he will alſo endevour to get ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection or excuſe for it; ſomething to warrant, or ſomething to undervalue it; and at laſt it ſhall be accounted venial, and by ſome means or other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:115796:101"/>with the hopes of heaven. He that is uſed to oppreſs the poor every day, thinks he is a charitable man if he lets them goe away with any thing he could have taken from them: But he is not troubled in conſcience for detaining the wages of the hireling, with deferring to doe juſtice, with little arts of exaction and leſſening their proviſions. For ſince nothing is great or little but in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with ſomething elſe, he accounts his ſin ſmall, becauſe he commits greater; and he that can ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the greateſt burden, ſhrinks not under a lighter weight; and upon this account it is impoſſible but ſuch men muſt be deceiv'd and die.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Let no man think that his venial or ſmaller ſins ſhall be pardoned for the ſmalneſs of their matter, and in a diſtinct account; for a man is not quit of the ſmalleſt but by being alſo quit of the greateſt: for God does not pardon any ſin to him that remains his enemy; and therefore unleſs the man be a good man and in the ſtate of grace, he cannot hope that his venial ſins can be in any ſenſe indulg'd; they increaſe the burden of the other, and are like little ſtones laid upon a ſhoulder al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cruſhed with an unequal load. Either God pardons the greateſt, or the leaſt ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancell'd.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> Although God never pardons the ſmalleſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt, yet he ſomtimes retains the ſmalleſt, of them whoſe greateſt he hath pardon'd. The reaſon is, becauſe although a man be in the ſtate of grace and of the Divine favour and God will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his ſervants for every calamity of theirs, yet he will not ſuffer any thing that is amiſs in them. A Father never pardons the ſmall offences of his ſon who is in rebellion againſt him; thoſe little offences can not pretend to pardon till he be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to his Father; but if he be, yet his Father may
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:115796:101"/>chaſtiſe his little miſdemeanors, or reſerve ſome of his diſpleaſure ſo far as may miniſter to diſcipline, not to deſtruction: and therefore if a ſon have eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped his Fathers anger and final diſpleaſure, let him remember, that though his Father is not willing to diſ-inherit him, yet he will be ready to chaſtiſe him. And we ſee it by the whole diſpenſation of God, that <hi>the righteous are puniſhed,</hi> and afflictions <hi>begin at the Houſe of God;</hi> and God is ſo impatient even of little evils in them, that to make them pure he will draw them through the fire; and there are ſome who are <hi>ſav'd, yet ſo as by fire.</hi> And certainly, thoſe ſins ought not to be neglected, or eſteemed little, which provoke God to anger even againſt his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.

                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> Every action of repentance, every good work done for the love of God and in the ſtate of grace, and deſign'd, and particularly applied to the interciſion of the ſmaileſt unavoidable ſins, is through the efficacy of Chriſts death, and in the vertue of repentance operative towards the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation or pardon of them. For a man cannot doe all the particulars of repentance for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſin; but out of the general hatred of ſin
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:115796:104"/>picks out ſome ſpecial inſtances, and apportions them to his ſpecial ſins; as to acts of uncleanneſs he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes acts of ſeverity, to intemperance he oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes faſting. But then as he reſts not here, but goes on to the conſummation of Repentance in his whole life: ſo it muſt be in the more venial ſins. A leſs inſtance of expreſs anger is graciouſly accepted, if it be done in the ſtate of grace and in the vertue of Repentance; but then the pardon is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in the purſuance and integrity of that grace, in the Summes total. For no man can ſay that ſo much ſorrow, or ſuch a degree of Repentance is enough to any ſin he hath done: and yet a man cannot apportion to every ſin large portions of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſorrow, it muſt therefore be done all his life time; and the little portions muſt be made up by the whole grace and ſtate of Repentance. One inſtance is enough particularly to expreſs the anger, or to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the grace of Repentance to any ſingle ſin which is not among the Capitals; but no one inſtance is enough to extinguiſh it. For ſin is not pardon'd in an inſtant (as I ſhall afterwards diſcourſe) neither is the remedy of a natural and a juſt proportion to the ſin.

                     </note> Therefore when many of the ancient Doctors apply to venial ſins ſpecial remedies by way of expiation, or deprecation, ſuch as are, <hi>beating the breaſt, ſaying the Lords Prayer, Alms, communicating, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing,</hi> and ſome others; the doctrine of ſuch reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies is not true, if it be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are juſt phyſically, or meritoriouſly proportion'd to the ſin. No one of theſe alone is a cure or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation of the paſt ſin; but every one of theſe in the vertue of Repentance is effective to its part of
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:115796:105"/>the work, that is, he that repents and forſakes them as he can, ſhall be accepted, though the expreſſion of his Repentance be applied to his fault but in one or more of theſe ſingle inſtances; becauſe all good works done in the Faith of Chriſt, have an efficacy towards the extinction of thoſe ſins which cannot be avoided by any moral diligence; there is no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing on our parts which can be done, and if that which is <hi>unavoidable</hi> were alſo <hi>irremediable,</hi> our condition would be intolerable and deſperate. To the ſenſe of this advice we have the words of S. <hi>Gregory: Si quis ergo peccata ſua tecta eſſe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derat, Deo ea per vocem confeſſionis oſtendat, &amp;c. <q>If any man deſires to have his ſins covered, let him firſt open them to God in confeſſion: but there are ſome ſins, which ſo long as we live in this world, can hurdly, or indeed not at all be wholly avoided by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect men.</q> For holy men have ſomething in this life, which they ought to cover; for it is altogether im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that they ſhould never ſin in word or thought. Therefore the men of God do ſtudy to cover the faults of their eyes or tongue with good deeds, they ſtudy to over-power the number of their idle words with the weight of good works. But how can it be that the faults of good men ſhould be covered, when all things are naked to the eyes of God? but onely becauſe that which is covered is put under, ſomething is brought over it: Our ſins are covered when we bring over them the cover of good works.</hi> But <hi>Caeſarius</hi> the Biſhop is more punctual, and deſcends to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. For having given this general rule, <hi>Illa par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va vel quotidiana peccata bonis operibus redimere non deſiſtant. Let them not ceaſe to redeem or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate their daily and ſmall faults with good works;</hi> he addes, <hi>But I deſire more fully to inſinuate to you, with what works ſmall ſins are taken off. So often as we viſit the ſick, go</hi> (in Charity) <hi>to them
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:115796:105"/>that are in priſon, reconcile variances, keep the faſts of the Church, waſh the feet of ſtrangers, repair to the vigils and watches of the Church, give alms to paſſing beggers, forgive our enemies when they ask pardon: iſtis enim operibus &amp; his ſimilibus mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuta peccata quotidiè redimuntur; with theſe and the like works the minute or ſmaller ſins are daily redeemed</hi> or taken off.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/> There is in Prayer a particular efficacy, and it is of proper uſe and application in the caſe of the more venial and unavoidable ſins, rather this then any other alone, eſpecially being helped by Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that is, alms and forgiveneſs. Becauſe the greateſt number of venial ſins comes in (as I ſhall

But becauſe they are beyond humane cure, they are to be cured by the Divine Grace, and this is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Prayer, And this S. <hi>Clement</hi> advis'd in his Epiſtle. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Lift up your eyes to God Almighty, praying him to be merciful to you, if you have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly fallen into errour. And to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are the words of S. <hi>Auſtin:
<note place="margin">De Symb. ad Catech. lib 1. c. 6. &amp; lib. 50. Homil. 28.</note> Propter levia ſine quibus eſſe non poſſumus, oratio inventae:</hi> for thoſe lighter ſins without which we cannot be, Prayer is invented as a remedy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> Perpetually watch, and perpetually reſolve againſt <hi>them,</hi> as againſt <hi>any,</hi> never indulging to thy ſelf leave to proceed in one. Let this care be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and indefatigable, and leave the ſucceſs to God. For in this there is a great difference between <hi>Capitall</hi> or <hi>Deadly,</hi> and the <hi>more venial ſins.</hi> For,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:115796:106"/>he that repents of great ſins, does ſo reſolve againſt them, that he ought really to believe that he ſhall never return to them again. No drunkard is truly to be eſteem'd a penitent, but he that in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of himſelf, his purpoſe, his reaſons, and all his circumſtances, is by the grace of God confident that he ſhall never be drunk again. The reaſon is plain: For if he thinks that for all his reſolution and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the caſe may happen, or will return in which he ſhall be tempted above his ſtrength, that is, above the efficacy of his reſolution, then he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved againſt the ſin in all its forms or inſtances: but he hath left ſome roots of bitterneſs which may ſpring up and defile him; he hath left ſome weak places, ſome parts unfortified, and does ſecretly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to give up his fort, if he be aſſaulted by ſome ſort of enemies. He is not reſolved to reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a friend, or a prevailing perſon, a Prince, his Landlord, or his Maſter; that for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent he thinks impoſſible, and therefore owes his ſpiritual life to chance, or to the mercies of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who may have it for asking: But if he thinks it poſſible to reſiſt any temptation, and reſolves to do it if it be poſſible, the natural conſequent of that is, that he thinks he ſhall never fall again into it. But if beforehand he thinks he ſhall relapſe, he is then but an imperfect reſolver, but a half-fac'd pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. * But this is not ſo in the caſe of ſmaller ſins coming by ignorance or ſurpriſe, by inadvertency and imperfect notices, by the unavoidable weakneſs and imperfect condition of mankinde. For he who in theſe reſolves the ſtrongeſt, knows that he ſhall not be innocent, but that he ſhall feel his weakneſs in the ſame or in other inſtances; and that this ſhall be his condition as long as he lives, that he ſhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes need to pray, <hi>Forgive me my treſpaſſes:</hi> and even his not knowing concerning all actions, and all
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:115796:106"/>words, and all thoughts, whether they be ſins or no, is a certain betraying him into a neceſſity of doing ſomething for the pardon of which Chriſt died, for the preventing of which a mighty care is neceſſary, in the ſuffering of which he ought to be humbled, and for the pardon of which he ought for ever to pray. And therefore S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> upon thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul; I am conſcious in nothing,</hi> that is, I do not know of any failing in my Miniſtery; ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

For beſides that ſome have called perjuries, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, envy injurious words, by lighter names and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of a little reproof, and having lived in wicked times, were betray'd into eaſier ſentences of thoſe ſins which they ſaw all mankind almoſt to practiſe, which was the caſe of ſome of the Doctors who lived in the time of thoſe Wars which broke the Roman Empire; beſides this, I ſay, <hi>venial ſins</hi> can rather be

                     <hi>deſcribed,</hi> then <hi>enumerated.</hi> For none are ſo in their nature, but all that are ſo, are ſo by accident; and according as ſins tend to excuſe, ſo they put on their degrees of veniality. No ſin is abſolutely venial, but in compariſon with others: Neither is any ſin at all times, and to all perſons alike venial. And therefore let no man venture upon it upon any miſtaken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence: They that think ſins are venial in their own nature, cannot agree which are venial, and which are not; and therefore nothing is in this caſe ſo certain, as that all that doctrine which does in any ſenſe repreſent ſins as harmleſs or tame Serpents, is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dangerous, and there is no ſafety, but by ſtriving againſt all beforehand, and repenting of all as there is need.</p>

It is as damnable to indulge leave to our ſelves to ſin little ſins as great ones: A man may be choaked with a raiſin, as well as with great morſels of fleſh; and a ſmall leak in a ſhip, if it be neglected, will as certainly ſink her as if ſhe ſprung a plank. Death is the wages of all; and damnation is the portion of the impenitent, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was the inſtance of their ſin. Though there are degrees of puniſhment, yet there is no difference of ſtate, as to this particular: and therefore we are tied to repent of all, and to daſh the little <hi>Babylonians</hi> againſt the ſtones, againſt the Rock that was ſmitten for us. For by the blood of Jeſus, and the tears of Repentance, and the watchfulneſs of a diligent, careful perſon, many of them ſhall be prevented, and all ſhall be pardoned.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> by <hi>a ſingle act,</hi> I mean, a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate act, a wilful, obſerv'd, known act; for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning acts by ſurpriſe, by incogitancy, by imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, I ſhall give a ſpecial account in a Chapter on purpoſe. To this therefore I anſwer by ſeveral propoſitions.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> There are ſome acts of ſin ſo vile, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous that they cannot be acted but by a great malice or depravation of the will; and doe ſuppoſe a man to be gone a great way from God before he can preſumptuouſly or wilfully commit any of them; ſuch as are <hi>idolatry, wilful murder, adultery, witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft, perjury, ſacrilege,</hi> and the like: ſuch which by reaſon of their evil effect are called <hi>peccata cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantia ad Dominum, crying ſins;</hi> as, <hi>oppreſſing wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, entring into the fields of the fatherleſs, killing a man by falſe accuſation, grinding the face of the poor,</hi>
                     <pb n="183" facs="tcp:115796:117"/>ſome ſort of <hi>unnatural luſts:</hi> or ſuch which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their ſcandal, and ſevere prohibitions of them, and their proper baſeneſs and unholineſs, are <hi>pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata vaſtantia conſcientiam,</hi> they lay a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence waſte; ſuch are all theſe that I have now reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. Now concerning every one of theſe there is amongſt wiſe and good men no queſtion, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of them is excluſive of a man from all his hopes of heaven, unleſs he repent timely and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually. For every act of theſe is ſuch as a man cannot be ſurpriſed in the commiſſion of it; he can have no ignorance, no neceſſity, no infirmity to leſſen or excuſe his fault; which becauſe it is very miſchievous in the event, expreſly and ſeverely, and by name forbidden, is alſo againſt holineſs, and againſt charity, againſt God, and againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement ſo apparently, that there is nothing to leſſen them into the neighbourhood of an excuſe, if he that commits them have a clear uſe of reaſon. Some acts of <hi>other ſins</hi> are ſuch which as they are innocent of doing miſchief to our neighbour, ſo they are forbidden onely in general; but concerning the particular there is not any expreſs certainty, as in <hi>drunkenneſs;</hi> which though every Chriſtian knows to be forbidden, yet concerning every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act it is not always ſo certain that it is <hi>drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs,</hi> becauſe the acts partake of <hi>more and leſs;</hi> which is not true in <hi>murder,</hi> in <hi>adultery, apoſtaſie, witchcraft,</hi> and the like: Beſides which, in ſome of the forbidden inſtances there are ſome degrees of ſurpriſe, even when there are ſome degrees of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption &amp; deliberation, which in others there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. Upon which conſiderations it is apparent that the ſingle acts of theſe greater ſins are equal to a habit in others, and are for the preſent, deſtructive of the ſtate of Gods favour, a man that does them is in the ſtate of damnation, till he hath repented;
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:115796:118"/>that is, no good man can doe one of theſe acts, and be a good man ſtill; he is a wicked perſon, and an enemy of God if he does.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> This is apparent in thoſe acts which can be done but once; as in parricide, or murdering our Father or Mother, and in the wilful murder of our ſelf. There can be no habit of theſe ſins; all their malignity is ſpent in one act; and the event is beſt declared by <hi>one of them;</hi> the man dies in his ſin, in that ſin which excludes him from heaven. Every act of theſe ſins is like the ſtinging of bees;
<q>—animámque in vulnere ponunt;</q> He cannot ſtrike again, he can ſin that ſin over no more; and therefore it is a ſingle act that damnes in that caſe. Now though it is by accident that theſe ſins can be but once acted, yet it is not by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident that theſe ſingle acts deſtroy the ſoul, but by their malice and evil effect, their miſchief or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs: it follows therefore that it is ſo in all the ſingle acts of theſe great crimes; for ſince they that cannot be habitual, yet are highly dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; the evil ſentence is upon every act of theſe greater crimes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> Concerning the ſingle acts of other ſins which are not ſo highly criminal, yet have a name in the Catalogues of condemn'd ſins, the ſentence in Scripture is the ſame; the penalty extreme, the fine is the whole intereſt: S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> ſeems onely to condemne the habit, <hi>Theeves,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 6.10.</note> drunkards, covetous, railers, &amp;c. ſhall not inherit the kindome of heaven.</hi> Now one act does not make them properly ſuch; a habit, not an act, denominates. But leſt this be expounded to be a permiſſion to commit ſingle acts,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.21.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> affixes the ſame penalty
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:115796:118"/>to the actions, as to the habits; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.21.</note> 
                     <hi>they that doe ſuch things;</hi> that is, the actions of thoſe ſins are damnable and excluſive from heaven as ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily as the habits. And however in moral accounts, or in <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> Ethicks, a man is not called by the name of a ſingle action, yet in all laws both of God and man he is. He that ſteals once is a thief, in the Courts of God and the King; and one act of adultery makes a man an adulterer; ſo that by this meaſure, [they that <hi>are ſuch</hi>] and [<hi>they</hi> that <hi>doe ſuch</hi> things] means the ſame; and the effect of both, is excluſion from the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> Single actions in Scripture are called, <hi>works of darkneſs, deeds of the body, works of the fleſh;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 8. Rom. 8.13.</note> and though they do not <hi>reign,</hi> yet if they enter, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the reſt and poſſeſſion of the ſpirit of grace; and therefore are in their ſeveral meaſures againſt the holineſs of the Goſpel of Chriſt. All ſins are ſingle in their acting; and a ſinful habit differs from a ſinful act, but as <hi>many</hi> differ from <hi>one,</hi> or as a year from an hour: a vicious habit is but one ſin conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued or repeated; for as a ſin grows from little to great, ſo it paſſes from act to habit: a ſin is greater becauſe it is complicated externally or internally, no other way in the world; it is made up of more kinds, or more degrees of choice; and when two or three crimes are mixt in one action, then the ſin is loud and clamorous; and if theſe ſtill grow more numerous, and not interrupted and disjoyned by a ſpeedy repentance, then it becomes a habit. As the continuation of an inſtant or its perpetual fluxe makes time and proper ſucceſſion, ſo does the reacting or the continuing in any one or more ſins make a habitual ſinner. So that in this Queſtion, the anſwer for one will ſerve for the other: where ever the habit is forbidden, there alſo the act is criminal and againſt God, damnable by the laws of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:115796:119"/>God, and actually damning without repentance. Between ſins great and little, actual and habitual, there is no difference of nature or formality, but onely of degrees.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> And therefore the words that repreſent the ſtate of ſin are uſed indifferently both for acts and habits. <gap reason="foreign">

<note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.8.</note> 
                     <hi>John:</hi> by which although he means eſpecially him that commits ſin frequently or habitually; for where there is greater reaſon, there is the ſtronger affirmative: yet that he muſt alſo mean it of ſingle ſins is evident, not onely by the nature of the thing, ſome ſingle acts in ſome inſtances being as miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous and malicious as a habit in others; but by the words of our bleſſed Saviour, that <hi>the Devil is the Father of lies;</hi> and therefore every one that tels a lie is of the Devil; <hi>eátenus.</hi> To which adde alſo the words of S. <hi>John</hi> explicating his whole deſign in theſe and all his other words; <hi>Theſe things I write unto you that ye might not ſin,</hi> that is, that ye might not doe ſinful actions; for it cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that he did not as verily intend to prevent every ſin, as any ſin, or that he would onely have men to beware of habitual ſins, and not of actual, ſingle ſins, without which caution he could never have prevented the habitual. <hi>To doe ſin</hi> is to do one, or to do many; and are both forbidden under the ſame danger.</p>
                  <p>The ſame manner of expreſſion in a differing matter hath a different ſignification.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> 
                     <hi>To doe ſin</hi> is to doe any one act of it: but <hi>to doe righteouſneſs</hi> is to doe it <hi>habitually. He that doeth ſin,</hi> that is, one act of ſin, <hi>is of the Devil;</hi> But <hi>he that doth righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> viz. habitually, <hi>he [onely] is righteous.</hi> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the difference is this, becauſe one ſin can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:115796:119"/>a man, but one act of vertue cannot make him alive. As a phial is broken, though but a piece of its lip be cut away; but it is not whole unleſs it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire and unbroken in every part.
<note place="margin">Dionyſ de Divin. Nomin.</note> 
                     <hi>Bonum ex integrâ cauſâ, malum ex qualibet particulari.</hi> And therefore ſince <hi>he that does righteouſneſs</hi> (in S. <hi>Johns</hi> phraſe) <hi>is righteous;</hi> and yet no man is righteous for doing one act of righteouſneſs; it follows, that by <hi>doing righteouſneſs,</hi> he muſt mean doing it <hi>habitually.</hi> But becauſe one blow can kill a man or wound him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperately; therefore when S. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>doing ſin,</hi> he means doing any ſin, any way, or in any degree of act or habit. For this is that we are commanded by the Spirit of Chriſt; we muſt <gap reason="foreign">

                     <note place="margin">Caeſar. Arelat. hom. 16.</note> intends that all his ſervants ſhould be ſo. For, <hi>let no man deceive himſelf. Omnis homo qui poſt baptiſmum mortalia crimina commiſerit; hoc eſt, homicidium, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terium, furtum, falſum teſtimonium, vel reliqua crimina perpetravit, unde per legem mundanam mori poterat, ſi poenitentiam non egerit, eleemoſynam juſtam non fece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, nunquam habebit vitam aeternam, ſed cum Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolo deſcendet ad inferna.</hi> 
                     <q>Every man who after his baptiſm hath committed mortal, or killing ſins, that is to ſay, murder, adultery, theft, falſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or any other crimes which are capital by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws, if he does not repent, if he does not give juſt meaſures of alms, he ſhall not have eternal life, but with the Devil he ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend into hell.</q> This is the ſad ſentence againſt
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:115796:120"/>all ſingle acts of ſin in the capital or greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                  <p>But upon this account who can be juſtified?
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> who can hope for heaven, ſince even the moſt righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous man that is, ſinneth; and by ſingle acts of unworthineſs interrupts his courſe of piety, and pollutes his ſpirit? If a ſingle act of theſe great or mortal ſins can ſtand with the ſtate of grace, then not acts of theſe but habits are forbidden, and theſe onely ſhut a man from heaven. But if one ſingle act deſtroys the ſtate of grace, and puts a man out of Gods favour, then no man abides in it long, and what ſhall be at the end of theſe things?</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> that ſingle acts are continually forbidden, and in every period of their commiſſion diſpleaſe God, and provoke him to anger. To abide in any one ſin, or to doe it often, or to love it, is againſt the Covenant of the Goſpel, and <hi>the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and nature of repentance,</hi> which is a converſion from ſin to righteouſneſs: but every ſingle act is againſt the <hi>cautions and watchfulneſs of repentance.</hi> It is an act of death, but not a ſtate; it is the way of death, but is not in the poſſeſſion of it. It is true that every ſingle act of fornication merits an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal hell, yet when we name it to be a ſingle act, we ſuppoſe it to be no more, that is, to be reſcin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and immediately cut off by a vigorous and proportionable repentance: if it be not, it is more then a ſingle act, for it is a habit, as I ſhall remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate in the Chapter of Habits. But then upon this account a ſingle act of any ſin may be incident to the ſtate of a good man, and yet not deſtroy his intereſts or his hopes; but it is upon no other ground but this, It is a ſingle act, and it does not abide there, but paſſes immediately into repentance: and then though it did interrupt or diſcompoſe the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:115796:120"/>ſtate of grace or the Divine favour, yet it did not deſtroy it quite. The man may pray <hi>Davids</hi> prayer: <hi>I have gone aſtray like a ſheep that is loſt:
<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. ult.</note> O ſeek thy ſervant, for I doe not forget thy Commandements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that if a man asks whether a good man falling into one act of theſe great ſins,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> ſtill remains a good man; the anſwer is to be made upon this conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, <hi>He is a good man that is ſo ſorry for his ſin, and ſo hates it, that he will not abide in it:</hi> and this is the beſt indication, that in the act there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very pityable, becauſe the mans affections abide not there; the good man was ſmitten in a weak part, or in an ill hour, and then repents: for ſuch is our <hi>goodneſs;</hi> to need repentance daily for ſmaller things, and too often for greater things. But be they great or little, they muſt be ſpeedily repented of; and he that does ſo, is <hi>a good man ſtill.</hi> Not but that the ſingle act is highly damnable, and excluſive of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if it ſelf were not excluded from his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: but it does not the miſchief, becauſe he does not ſuffer it to proceed in finiſhing that death which it would have effected, if the poiſon had not been ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily expelled, before it had ſeis'd upon a vital part.</p>
                  <p>But 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> I anſwer, that being in the ſtate of grace is a phraſe of the Schools, and is of a large and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt infinite comprehenſion. Every Chriſtian is in ſome degree in the ſtate of grace, ſo long as he is invited to Repentance, and ſo long as he is capable of the Prayers of the Church. This we learn from thoſe words of S. <hi>John, All unrighteouſneſs is ſin,
<note place="margin">1 Joh: 5.17.</note> and there is a ſin not unto death;</hi> that is, ſome ſorts of ſins are ſo incident to the condition of men, and their ſtate of imperfection, that the man who hath committed them is ſtill within the methods of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and hath not forfeited his title to the Promiſes and Covenant of Repentance: But <hi>there is a ſin unto death;</hi> that is, ſome men proceed beyond the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:115796:121"/>meaſures and Oeconomy of the Goſpel, and the uſuall methods and probabilities of Repentance, by obſtinacy, and perſevering in ſin, by a wilful, ſpiteful reſiſting, or deſpiſing the offers of grace and the means of pardon; for ſuch a man S. <hi>John</hi> does not encourage us to pray: If he be ſuch a perſon as S. <hi>John</hi> deſcribed, our prayers will do him no good; but becauſe no man can tell the laſt minute or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of pardon, nor juſt when a man is gone beyond the limit; and becauſe the limit it ſelf can be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, and Gods mercies ſtay for ſome <hi>longer</hi> then for others, therefore S. <hi>John</hi> left us under this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite reſtraint and caution; which was decretory enough to repreſent that ſad ſtate of things in which the refractary and impenitent have immerged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and yet ſo indefinite and cautious, that we may not be too forward in applying it to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, nor in preſcribing meaſures to the Divine Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor paſſing final ſentences upon our brother, before we have heard our Judge himſelf ſpeak. <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a ſin not unto death,</hi> is an expreſſion fully ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying that there are ſome ſins which though they be committed and diſpleaſe God, and muſt be repented of, and need many and mighty prayers for their pardon, yet the man is in the ſtate of grace and pardon, that is, he is within the Covenant of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, he may be admitted to repentance, if he will return to his duty: So that being in the ſtate of grace, is having a title to Gods loving kindneſs, a not being rejected of God, but a being beloved by him to certain purpoſes of mercy, and that hath theſe meaſures and degrees.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> A wicked Chriſtian that lives vilely, and yet is called to Repentance by the vigorous and fervent Sermons of the Goſpel, is in a ſtate of grace, of this grace. God would fain ſave him, willing he is and deſirous he ſhould live; but his mercy to him
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:115796:121"/>goes but thus farre, that he ſtill continues the means of his ſalvation; he is angry with him, but not finally. The Jews were in ſome portions of this ſtate until the final day came in which God would not be merciful any more: <hi>Even in this thy day, O Jeruſalem,</hi> ſaid our bleſſed Saviour; ſo long as their day laſted, their ſtate of grace laſted, God had mercy for them, if they had had gracious hearts to receive it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> But he that begins to leave his ſins, and is in a continual conteſtation againſt them, and yet falls often, even moſt commonly, at the return of the temptation, and ſin does in ſome meaſure prevail; he is in the ſtate of a further grace, neerer to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as he is nearer to holineſs; his hopes are grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and nearer to performance, <hi>He is not farre from the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> ſo our bleſſed Lord expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the like condition; he is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>ordered, diſpos'd towards life eternal:</hi> and this is a further approach towards the ſtate of life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> He that loves no ſin, but hath overcome his affections to all, and hates all, but yet with ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect a choice or averſation, that his faith is weak, and his repentance like an infant; this man is in a better ſtate then both the former: <hi>God will not quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed reed;</hi> God hath in ſome meaſure prevail'd upon him: and as God is ready to receive the firſt unto <hi>the means,</hi> and the ſecond unto <hi>the grace of Repentance;</hi> ſo this third he is ready to receive <hi>unto pardon,</hi> if he ſhall grow and perſevere in grace. And theſe are the ſeveral ſtages and periods of being in the ſtate of grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. With the firſt of theſe not onely an act, but a habit of ſin is conſiſtent; but how long and how farre, God onely knows.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. With the ſecond period a frequency of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:115796:122"/>into ſingle ſins is conſiſtent: But if he comes not out of this ſtate, and proceed to the third pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, he will relapſe to the firſt, he muſt not ſtay here long.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But they that are in the third period, do ſometimes fall into ſingle ſins, but it is but ſeldome, and it is without any remanent portion of affection, but not without much diſpleaſure and a ſpeedy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; and to this perſon, the proper remedy is to grow in grace, for if he does not, he cannot either be ſecure of the preſent, or confident of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But then if by being in the ſtate of grace is meant a being actually pardon'd and beloved of God unto ſalvation, ſo that if the man dies ſo, he ſhall be ſaved, it is certain that every deliberate ſin, every act of ſin that is conſidered and choſen, puts a man out of the ſtate of grace; that is, the act of ſin is ſtill upon his account, he is not actually pardon'd in that for any other worthineſs of ſtate, or rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſon; he muſt come to new accounts for that; and if he dies without a moral retractation of it, he is in a ſad condition, if God ſhould deal with him <hi>ſummo jure,</hi> that is, <hi>be extreme to mark that which was done amiſs.</hi> The ſingle act is highly damnable; the <hi>wages of it are death,</hi> it <hi>defiles a man,</hi> it excludes from heaven, it <hi>grieves the holy Spirit of grace,</hi> it is againſt his undertaking, and in its own proportion againſt all his hopes: if it be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, it will bear the man to Hell; but then how it comes to be pardon'd in good men, and by what meaſures of favour and proper diſpenſation, is next to be conſidered. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> Though by the nature of the thing and the laws of the Covenant, every ſingle deliberate act of ſin provokes God to anger, who therefore may pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh it by the ſevereſt laws which he decreed againſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:115796:122"/>it; yet by the Oeconomy of God and the Divine Diſpenſation it is ſometimes otherwiſe. For beſides the eternal wrath of God, there are ſome that ſuffer his temporal; ſome ſuffer both, ſome but one. God uſes to ſmite them whom he would make to be, or them who are his ſons, if they do amiſs. If a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man be ſmitten with a temporal judgement, and thence begins to fear God and to return, the anger will go no further; and therefore much rather ſhall ſuch temporal judgements upon the good man that was <hi>overtaken in a fault</hi> be the whole exaction. God ſmites them that ſin theſe ſingle ſins, and though he could take all, yet will demand but a fine.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> But even this alſo God does not do, but in the caſe of ſcandal or danger to others: as it was in the particular of <hi>David, Becauſe thou haſt made the enemies of God to blaſpheme, the childe that is born un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee ſhall die:</hi> or elſe 2. When the good man is negligent of his danger, or dilatory in his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and careleſs in his watch, then God awakens him with a judgement, ſent with much mercy.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> But ſometimes a temporal death happens to good men ſo overtaken; It happened ſo to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> for their fault at the waters of <hi>Maſſah</hi> and <hi>Meribah;</hi> to the Prophet of <hi>Judah</hi> that came to cry out againſt the Altar in <hi>Bethel;</hi> to <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah</hi> for touching the Ark with unhallowed fingers, though he did it in zeal; to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> who had not obſerved decent meaſures in receiving the holy Sacrament; and thus it happened (ſay ſome of the ancient Doctors) to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira;</hi> God took a fine of them alſo <hi>ſalvo contenemento,</hi> their main ſtake being ſecured,
<q>—Culpam hanc miſerorum morte piabant.</q> There is in theſe inſtances this difference: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were not ſmitten in their ſin, but for it,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:115796:123"/>and (as is not doubted) after they had repented: but <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah,</hi> and the Prophet, and <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> and the <hi>Corinthians</hi> died not onely <hi>for their ſin,</hi> but <hi>in it</hi> too: and yet it is hoped Gods anger went no further then that death, becauſe in every ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who lives well, and yet is overtaken in a fault, there is much of infirmity and imperfection of choice, even when there are ſome degrees of wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and a wicked heart. And though it be eaſie to ſuppoſe that ſuch perſons in the beginning of that judgement, and the approach of that death, did morally retract the ſinful action by an act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and that upon that account they found the effect of the Divine mercies by the blood of the Lamb who was ſlain from the beginning of the world, yet if it ſhould happen that any of them die ſo ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as not to have power to exerciſe one act of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though the caſe be harder, yet it is to be hoped that even the habitual repentance and hatred of ſin by which they pleaſed God in the greater portions of their life, will have ſome influence upon this alſo. But this caſe is but ſeldome, and Gods mercies are very great and glorious; but becauſe there is in this caſe no warrant, and this caſe may happen oftner then it does, even to any one that ſins one wilful ſin, it is enough to all conſidering perſons to make them fear: <hi>but the fool ſinneth and is confident.</hi>

                  <p n="8">8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> But if ſuch overtaken perſons do live, then Gods Diſpenſation is all mercy, even though he ſtrikes the ſinner, for he does it for good. For God is merciful and knows our weakneſſes, our natural and circumſtant follies: he therefore recals the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man, he ſtrikes him ſharply, or he corrects him gently, or he calls upon him haſtily, as God pleaſe, or as the man needs. The man is fallen from the favour or grace of God, but (I ſay) fallen onely from one ſtep of grace; and God is more ready to receive
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:115796:123"/>him, then the man is to return; and provided that he repent ſpeedily, and neither adde a new crime, nor neglect this, his ſtate of grace was but allayed and diſordered, not broken in pieces or deſtroyed.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> UPon conſideration of the premiſſes it appears to be dangerous <hi>practically</hi> to inquire how far ſingle acts of ſin can ſtand with the ſtate of grace, or the being of a good man. For they ought not to be at all, and if they be once, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and the ſin muſt be pardoned, or we die: And when it can be ask'd how far any ſin can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſtate of Gods favour, it cannot be meant that God indulges it to a good man with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, or that his grace and favour conſiſts in this that he may ſafely ſin once or twice in what inſtance or in any inſtance he ſhall chooſe: but in this it does; a ſingle act of ſin does not ſo deſtroy the hopes of a good man, but that if he returns ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he ſhall be pardoned ſpeedily; for this, God will doe for him, not by permitting him to ſin again, but by taking his ſin away, and healing his ſoul; but how ſoon, or how much, or how long God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don or forbear, he hath no way told us. * For in the ſeveral ſtates and periods of the ſoul in order to vertue or vice reſpectively, there is no ſpecifical difference but of degrees onely, not of ſtate. As
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:115796:125"/>the ſins are more or longer, God is more angry, and the man further off; but the man is not wholly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered from his ſtate of grace till he be arriv'd at the unpardonable condition. He is a <hi>good,</hi> or an <hi>evil man,</hi> more or leſs, according as he ſins or repents. For neither of the appellatives are abſolute and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective; and though in philoſophy we uſe to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count them ſuch by the prevailing ingredient, yet the meaſures of the ſpirit are otherwiſe. The whole affair is arbitrary, and gradual, various by its own meaſures and the good pleaſure of God, ſo that we cannot in theſe things which are in perpetual flux, come to any certain meaſures. But although in judging of events we are uncertain, yet in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of repentance we can be better guided. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore firſt in general:</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> rule is a prudent meaſure, <hi>Quàm magna deliquimus, tam granditèr defleamus; ut poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentia crimine minor non ſit.</hi> According to the greatneſs of the ſin, ſo muſt be the greatneſs of the ſorrow: and therefore we are in our beginnings and progreſſions of repentance to conſider all the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                     <hi>circumſtances of aggravation,</hi> 
                     <hi rend="sup">2</hi> the <hi>complication</hi> of the crime, <hi rend="sup">3</hi> the <hi>ſcandal</hi> and <hi rend="sup">4</hi> 
                     <hi>evil effect;</hi> and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to every one of theſe, the ſorrow is to be enlarged and continued. For if it be neceſſary to be afflicted becauſe we have done evil; it is alſo neceſſary that our affliction and grief be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to all the parts of evil: becauſe a ſin grows greater by being more in <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>choice,</hi> in the <hi>inſtances,</hi> or in the <hi>adheſion;</hi> and as two ſins muſt be deplored more then one, ſo muſt two degrees, that is, the greater portions of malice and wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be mourned for with a bigger ſorrow then the leſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> Every ſingle act of ſin muſt be cut off by a moral revocation, or à contrary act; by which I
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:115796:125"/>mean, an expreſs hatred and deteſtation of it. For an act of ſin being in its proportion an <hi>averſion</hi> or turning from God, and repentance being in its whole nature a <hi>converſion</hi> to him, that act muſt be deſtroyed as it can be. Now becauſe that which is done, cannot <hi>naturally</hi> be made undone, it muſt <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally;</hi> that is, it muſt be revok'd by an act of noliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and hatred of it, and a wiſhing it had never been done, for that is properly a <hi>converſion</hi> from that act of ſin.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> But becauſe in ſome caſes a moral revocation may be like an ineffective reſolution, therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the inward <hi>nolition</hi> or hating of the ſin, in all ſignal and remarked inſtances of ſin, it is highly requiſite that the ſinning man doe oppoſe an act of vertue to the act of ſin in the ſame inſtance where it is capable; as to an act of gluttony, let him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an act of abſtinence; to an act of uncleanneſs, an act of purity and chaſtity; to anger and fierce contentions, let him oppoſe charity and ſilence: for to hate ſin and not to love vertue is a <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi> and to pretend it is <hi>hypocriſie.</hi> But beſides this, as the nolition or hatred of it does (if it be real) deſtroy the moral being of that act, ſo does the contrary act deſtroy its naturall being (as far as it is capable.) And however it be, yet it is upon this account neceſſary. For ſince one act of ſin delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately choſen was an ill beginning and inlet of a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, it is neceſſary that there be as much done to obtain the habit of the contrary vertue, as was done towards the habit of vice; that to God as intire a reſtitution as can, may be made of his own right, and purchaſed inheritance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> Every act of ſin is a diſpleaſure to God and a provocation of an infinite Majeſty, and therefore the repentance for it muſt alſo have other meaſures then by the natural and moral proportions. One act
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:115796:126"/>of ſorrow is a moral revocation of one act of ſin, and as much a natural deletion of it as the thing is capable. * But there is ſomething more in it then thus, for a ſingle act of ſin deſerves an eternal hell; and upon what account ſoever that be, it is fit that we doe ſomething of repentance in relation to the offence of an infinite God: and therefore let our repentance proceed towards infinite as much as it may: my meaning is, that we doe not finally reſt in a moral revocation of an act by an act, but that we beg for pardon all our days even for that one ſin. * For beſides that every ſin is againſt an infinite God, and ſo ought to be waſh'd off with a ſorrow as near to infinite as we can; we are not certain in what periods of ſorrow God will ſpeak to us in the accents of mercy and voice of pardon: He always takes of them that repent, leſs then he could in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice exact if he ſo pleaſed, but how much leſs he will take, he hath no where told us, and therefore let us make our way as ſecure as we can; let us ſtill goe on in repentance, and in the progreſſion we are ſure to meet with God. * But there is in it yet more. For however the act of ſin be uſually called and ſuppoſed to be a ſingle act, yet if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how many fancies and temptations were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory to it, how many conſentings to the ſin, how many deſires and acts of proſecution, what contrivances, and reſiſtances of the holy motions of Gods Spirit and the checks of conſcience how many refuſings of God and his laws, what unfitting means and ſinful progreſſions were made to arrive thither, what criminal and undecent circumſtances, what degrees of conſent, and approaches to a perfect choice, what vitious hopes, and vile fears, what ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of time and miſ-imployed paſſions were in one act of fornication or murder, oppreſſion of the poore, or ſubornation of witneſſes, we ſhall finde
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:115796:126"/>that the proportions will be too little to oppoſe but one act of vertue againſt all theſe evils; eſpecially ſince an act of vertue (as we order our affairs) is much more ſingle then in act of vice is.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> Every ſingle act of vice may and muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of particularly, if it be a wilful, deliberate, and obſerved action. A general repentance will not ſerve the turn in theſe caſes. When a man hath forgotten the particulars, he muſt make it up as well as he can. This is the evil of a delayed repentance, it is a thouſand to one but it is imperfect and lame, general and unactive; it will need arts of ſupply and collateral remedies, and reflexe actions of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and what the effect will be is in many degrees uncertain: But if it be ſpeedy, and particular, the remedy is the more eaſy, the more ready, and the more certain. But when a man is overtaken in a fault, he muſt be reſtored again as to that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; for by that he tranſgreſſed, there he is ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and wounded, in that inſtance the habit begins, and at that door the Divine judgement may enter, for his anger is there already. For although God pardons all ſins or none in reſpect of the final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and eternal pain, yet God ſtrikes particular ſins with proper and ſpecifick puniſhments in this life, which if they be not diverted by proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications may break us all in pieces. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Davids</hi> repentance was particularly applied to his ſpecial caſe, of murder and adultery: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome ſins are harder to be pardoned, and harder to be cured then others, it is certain they muſt be taken off by a ſpecial regard. A <hi>general repentance</hi> is never ſufficient, but when there cannot be a <hi>particular.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> Whoever hath committed any one act of a great crime, let him take the advantage of his firſt ſhame and regret, and in the activity of that paſſion
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:115796:127"/>let him deſign ſome faſting days, as the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his repentance, which he muſt imploy in the bitterneſs of his ſoul, in deteſtation of his ſin, in judging, condemning, and executing ſentence upon himſelf; and in all the actions of repentance, which are the parts and fruits of this duty, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he ſhall finde them deſcribed in their proper places.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the meaſures of repentance for ſingle acts of deliberate ſin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> when they have no other appendage, or proper Conſideration. But there are ſome acts of ſin, which by ſeveral ways and meaſures paſs into habits, directly, or by equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency and moral value.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For 1. The repetition of acts and proceeding in the ſame crime is a perfect habit, which as it riſes higher to obſtinacy, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, to reſolutions never to repent, to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, to final impenitence, ſo it is ſtill more killing and damnable.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. If a man ſins often in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inſtances it is a habit, properly ſo called; for although the inſtances be ſingle, yet the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and diſaffection are united and habitual. 3.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> When a ſingle act of ſin is done, and the guilt remains, not reſcinded by repentance, that act which naturally is but ſingle, yet morally is habitual. Of theſe I ſhall give account in the next Chapter where they are of proper conſideration. But there are yet three ways more by which ſingle acts doe become habits by equivalency and moral value, and are here to be conſidered accordingly.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> Firſt, if a ſingle act of ſin have a permanent matter, ſo long as that matter remains, the ſin is uncancell'd. Of this nature is theft, which cannot be cut off by a moral revocation, or an internal act: there muſt be ſomething done without. For it is a contradiction to ſay that a man is ſorry for his act of ſtealing, who yet rejoyces in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:115796:127"/>and retains it: Every man that repents, is bound to make his ſinful act as much as he can to be undone: and the moral revocation or nolition of it, is our entercourſe with God onely, who takes and accepts that, which is the All which can be done to him. But God takes care of our brother alſo, and therefore will not accept his own ſhare unleſs all intereſted perſons be ſatisfied as much as they ought. There is a great matter in it, that our neighbour alſo do forgive us, that his intereſt be ſerved, that he do not deſire our puniſhment: of this I ſhall afterwards give accounts; in the mean time, if the matter of our ſin be not taken away, ſo long as it remains, ſo long there is a remanency and a tarrying in it, and that is a degree of habit.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> Secondly, if the ſingle act have a continual fluxe or emanation from it ſelf, it is as a habit by moral account, and is a principle of action, and is potentially many. Of this nature is every action whoſe proper and immediate principle is a paſſion. Such as hatred of our neighbour, a fearfulneſs of perſecution, a love of pleaſures. For a man cannot properly be ſaid to have an act of hatred, an actual expreſſion of it he may; but if he hates him in one act, and repents not of it, it is a vicious affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in the ſenſe of moral Theology it is a habit; the law of God having given meaſures to our affections as well as to actions. In this caſe when we have committed one act of uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or hatred, it is not enough to oppoſe againſt it one act of love; but the principle muſt be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and the love of our neighbour muſt be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into our ſpirit.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> There is yet another ſort of ſinful action which does in ſome ſenſe equal a habit, and that is an act of the greateſt and moſt crying ſins, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated ſin.

<pb n="204" facs="tcp:115796:128"/>adultery; for a childe to accuſe his Father falſly; to oppreſs a widow in judgement, are ſins of a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous proportion; they are three or four ſins apeece, and therefore are to be repented of by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twining the knot, and cutting aſunder every thred: He that repents of adultery, muſt repent of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and of his injuſtice or wrong to his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and of his own breach of faith, and of his tempting a poor ſoul to ſin and death; and he muſt make amends for the ſcandal beſides, in caſe there was any in it. In theſe, and all the like caſes let no man flatter himſelf when he hath wept and prayed againſt his ſin; one ſolemnity is not ſufficient; one act of contrition is but the beginning of a repentance; and where the crime is capital by the laws of wiſe Nations, the greateſt, the longeſt, the ſharpeſt repentance is little enough in the Court of conſcience.

But it is much worſe if he ſins on; not onely becauſe he ſins oftner, but becauſe if he contracts a cuſtome or habit of ſin, he ſuperaddes a ſtate of evil to himſelf, diſtinct from the guilt of all thoſe ſingle actions which made the habit. This I ſhall endevour to prove againſt the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:115796:133"/>of the Romane Schools, who teach;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> That no man is ordinarily bound to repent inſtantly of his ſin; for the precept of repentance being affirmative, it does not oblige to its preſent or ſpeedy performance:
<note place="margin">Navarr. Compend.

                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If the duty of repentance be indiſpenſably requir'd in the danger of death, and he that does not repent when he is arreſted with the probability of ſo ſad a change is <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> uncharitable to himſelf and a murderer of his own ſoul, then ſo is he in his proportion who puts it off one day: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every day of delay is a day of danger; and the ſame law of charity obliges him to repent to day if he ſinn'd yeſterday, leſt he be dead before to morrow. The neceſſity indeed is not ſo great, and the duty is not ſo urgent, and the refuſal is not ſo great a ſin in health, as in ſickneſs, and dangers imminent and viſible: But there are degrees of <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity</hi> as there are degrees of <hi>danger:</hi> And he that conſiders how many perſons die ſuddenly, and how many more may, and no man knows that he ſhall not, cannot but confeſs that becauſe there is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, there is alſo an obligation of duty and charity to repent ſpeedily, and that <hi>poſitively,</hi> or <hi>careleſly</hi> to put it off, is a new fault and increaſes Gods en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt him. He that is well, may die to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. He that is very ſick, may recover and live many years. If therefore a <hi>periculum ne fiat,</hi> a danger leſt repentance be never done, is a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Divine Commandement to <hi>doe it then,</hi> it is certain that it is in every inſtant deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately neceſſary; becauſe in every inſtant there is danger. In all great ſickneſſes there is not an
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:115796:135"/>equal danger; yet in all great ſickneſſes it is a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular ſin not to repent, even by the confeſſion of all ſides; it is ſo therefore in all the periods of an uncertain life; <hi>a ſin,</hi> but <hi>in differing degrees.</hi> And therefore this is not an argument of <hi>caution</hi> onely, but of <hi>duty.</hi> For therefore it is of <hi>duty,</hi> becauſe it is of <hi>caution.</hi> It could not be a <hi>caution,</hi> unleſs there were a danger; and if there be a <hi>danger,</hi> then it is a duty. For he that is very ſick muſt do it. But how if he eſcapes, was he obliged for all that? He was, becauſe he knew not that he ſhould eſcape. By the ſame reaſon is every one obliged, becauſe whether he ſhall or ſhall not eſcape the next minute, he knows not. And certainly, it was none of the leaſt reaſons of Gods concealing the day of our death, that we might ever ſtand ready. And this is plainly enough taught us by our bleſſed Saviour, laboriouſly perſwading and commanding us not to defer our repentance, <hi>by his parable</hi> of the rich man who promiſed to himſelf the pleaſures of many years: he reprov'd that folly with a <hi>Stulte hac nocte;</hi> and it may be any mans caſe; for

                     </gap>, ready for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, alwayes watching, as uncertain of the time, but in perpetual expectation of the day of our Lord. I think nothing can be ſaid fuller to this purpoſe.
<note place="margin">In Pſal. 114.</note> But I adde the words of S. <hi>Auſtin; Verum quidem dicis quòd Deus poenitentiae tuae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentiam promiſit, ſed huic dilationi tuae craſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num non promiſit.</hi> To him that repents, God hath promiſed pardon, but to him that defers repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he hath not promiſed the reſpite of one day.

                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I conſider, that although the precept of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance be affirmative, yet it is alſo limited, and the time ſufficiently declared, even the preſent and none elſe. As ſoon as ever you need it, ſo ſoon you are obliged. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voyce, harden not your hearts.</hi> That is, deferre not to hear him, this day; for every putting it off is a <hi>hardning your hearts.</hi> For he that ſpeaks to day, is not pleaſed if you promiſe to hear him to morrow. It was <hi>Felix</hi> his caſe to S. <hi>Paul, Go away, I will hear thee ſome other time.</hi> He that cals every day, means every day that we ſhould repent. For although to moſt men God gives time and leiſure, and expects and perſeveres to call, yet this is not becauſe he gives them leave to defer it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſtill forbears to ſtrike, though their ſin grows greater. Now I demand, when God cals us to repentance, is it indifferent to him whether
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:115796:136"/>we repent to day or no? Why does he call ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, if he deſires it ſo coldly? Or if he be not indifferent, is he diſpleas'd if we repent ſpeedily? This no man thinks. But is he not diſpleas'd if we do not? Does not every call, and every expectation, and every meſſage, when it is rejected, provoke Gods anger and exaſperate him? Does not he in the day of vengeance ſmite more ſorely, by how much with the more patience he hath waited? This cannot be denied. But then it follows, that every delay did grieve him and diſpleaſe him, and therefore it is of it ſelf a provocation diſtinct from the firſt ſin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> But further let it be conſidered: If we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent to day, it is either a duty ſo to do, or onely a counſel of perfection, a work of ſupererogation. If it be a duty, then to omit it is a ſin. If it be a work of <hi>ſupererogation,</hi> then he that repents to day, does not do it in obedience to a Commandement: for <hi>this</hi> is ſuch a work (by the confeſſion of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Schools) which if a man omits he is neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in the ſtate of grace and the Divine favour; as he that does not vow perpetual Chaſtity, or Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is nevertheleſs the ſervant of God; but he that does not repent to day of his yeſterdayes ſin, is not Gods ſervant, and therefore this cannot be of the nature of Counſels, but of Precept and duty reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively. But to put it paſt all queſtion: It is expreſly commanded us by our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Agree with thine adverſary</hi>

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>quickly.</hi> For as it is amongſt men of merciful diſpoſitions, he that yields quickly obtains mercy; but he that ſtands out as long as he can, muſt expect the rigour of the law: So it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and us; a haſty Repentance reconciles graciouſly, whileſt the delay and putting it off, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes his ſevere anger.

                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Adde to this, that though God gives time and reſpite to ſome, yet to all he does not. God takes away ſome in their early ſins, and gives them no reſpite, not a moneth, not a week, not a day; and let any man ſay, whether this be not a ſufficient indication not onely that no man can be ſecure, but he alone that repents inſtantly, but that God does intend that every man ſhould preſently repent; for he that hath made it <hi>damnation</hi> to ſome for not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting inſtantly, hath made it <hi>damnable</hi> to all, and therefore to repent ſpeedily is certainly a duty. The earth does not open and ſwallow up all Rebels in the day of their Mutiny; but it did ſo once, and by that God did ſufficiently conſign to all ages his diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt Rebelſion. So it is in the deferring Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. That ſome have ſmarted for it eternally, is for ever enough to tell us, that God is diſpleaſed with every one that does defer it; and therefore
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:115796:137"/>commands us not to defer it. But this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſufficiently heightned upon this account: For there is no ſinner dies, but he is taken away without one dayes reſpite. For though God did many times forbear him, yet now he does not, and to his laſt ſin, or his laſt refuſal to hear God, either he afforded no time, or no grace of Repentance.</p>

                     <hi>Pauls</hi> diſcourſe and treaty of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> is ſufficient to guide us here: he fear'd that at his coming again God <hi>would humble him,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.21.</note> afflict him with grief and ſorrow to ſee it, that himſelf ſhould be forc'd <hi>to bewail many,</hi> that is, to excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, or deliver to Satan <hi>them that have ſinn'd already, and have not repented.</hi> If they had repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before S. <hi>Pauls</hi> coming, they ſhould eſcape that rod; but for deferring it, they were like to ſmart bitterly. Neither ought it to be ſuppoſed that the not repenting of ſins is no otherwiſe then as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcovered of theft. The thief dies for his rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, not for his being diſcovered; though if he were not diſcovered, he ſhould have eſcaped for his theft. So for their uncleanneſs S. <hi>Paul</hi> would have delivered them over to Satan, not for their not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſpeedily. For the caſe is wholly differing here. A thief is not bound at all to diſcover himſelf to the Criminal Judge; but every man is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. If therefore his repenting ſpeedily would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſo great a calamity as his being delivered over to Satan, beſides the procuring his eternal pardon, it is clear that to repent ſpeedily was great charity, and great neceſſity; which is that which was to be prov'd. Satan ſhould have power over him to afflict him for his ſin, if he did not ſpeedily repent: but if he did repent ſpeedily, he ſhould wholly eſcape; therefore to repent ſpeedily is a duty which God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of us, and will puniſh if it be omitted.</p>

To ſome men, and at ſome times God is implacably angry; ſome men, and at ſome times God hath in his fury and ſudden anger ſeis'd upon, with the apprehenſions of death and ſaddeſt judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and broken them all in pieces: and as there is a reign and kingdome of Mercy, ſo there are ſudden irruptions of a fierce Juſtice, of which God hath therefore given us examples, that we may not defer Repentance one day.

For ſo long as we are out of Gods favour, under the ſeiſure and arreſt of eternal guilt, ſo long we are in a ſtate of enmity with God, and all our actions are like the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances of Heathens, nothing to eternal life, but miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpendings of our powers, and prodigalities of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and wiſe diſcourſes; they are not perfective of our being, neither do they ſet us forward to heaven, until our ſtate be changing Either then we are not by a certain Law and Commandement bound every day to ſerve God and pleaſe him, or elſe we are poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and ſtrictly bound inſtantly to repent of all our ſins: becauſe ſo long as a known ſin is unrepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, we cannot ſerve God, we cannot do any thing that ſhall be acceptable to him in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Every delaying of Repentance is one ſtep of progreſſion towards final Impenitence; which is not onely then eſteem'd a ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt when a man reſolves never to repent, but if by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:115796:139"/>he neglects, or out of tediouſneſs and an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious ſpirit quite puts off, or for ever paſs by, it is unpardonable; <hi>it ſhall never be forgiven in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> Now ſince final im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitence is the conſummation and perfection of all ſin, we are to remember, that it is nothing but a perſeverance of neglecting, or refuſing to repent. A man is alwayes dying, and that which we call death is but the finiſhing of death, the laſt act of it: So is final impenitence, nothing but the ſame ſin told over ſo many dayes; it is a perſevering careleſneſs, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and therefore it cannot be the ſin of one day, unleſs it be by accident; it is a ſtate of ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun as ſoon as ever the ſin is acted, and grows in every day of thy negligence or forgetfulneſs. But if it ſhould happen that a ſinner that ſinn'd yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſhould die to day, his deferring his Repentance that one day would be eſteem'd ſo, and indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be a final impenitence. It follows therefore, that to put off our Repentance one day, differs onely accidentally and by chance from the worſt of evils, from final impenitence; it is the beginning of it, it differs from it, as an infant from a man; it is materially the ſame ſin, and may alſo have the ſame formality.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> I mean the facility and eaſineſs, the delight and cuſtome of ſinning contracted by the repetition of the acts of the ſame ſin; as a habit of drunkenneſs, a habit of ſwearing, and the like; that is, a quality inherent in the ſoul, whereby we work with pleaſure:

                     </gap>: And ſo long as any man ſins willingly, readily, frequently, and upon every temptation, or moſt commonly; ſo long he is an habitual ſinner: when he does his actions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with pain, and of his ſin with pleaſure, he is in the ſtate of death, and enmity againſt God. And as by frequent playing upon an inſtrument a man gets a habit of playing; ſo he does in renewing the actions of the ſame ſin, there is an evil quality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, which affects and corrupts his ſoul. * But concerning the nature of a vicious habit, this alſo is to be added.</p>
                  <p>That a vicious habit is not onely contracted by the repetition of acts in the ſame kinde,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> but by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of ſinning in any variety of inſtances what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. For there are many vicious perſons who have an <hi>ambulatory impiety,</hi> and ſin in all, or moſt of their opportunities; but their occaſions are not uniform, and therefore their irregularities are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:115796:140"/>and by chance for the inſtance, but regular and certain in the prevarication. <hi>Vetuleius Pavo</hi> would be ſure to be drunk at the feaſts of <hi>Saturn,</hi> and take a ſurfet in the <hi>Calends of January;</hi> he would be wanton at the <hi>Floralia,</hi> and bloudy in the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres: he would be prodigal upon his birth day, and on the day of his marriage ſacrifice <hi>Hecatombs</hi> to his <hi>Pertunda Dea,</hi> and he would be ſure to obſerve all the ſolemnities and feſtivals of vice in their own particulars and inſtances, and thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a good man enough, becauſe he could not be called a drunkard or a glutton for one act, and by ſinning ſingly eſcap'd the appellatives of ſcorn, which are uſually fix'd upon vain perſons that are married to one ſin. * Naturally to contract the habit of any one ſin is like the entertaining of a Concubine, and dwelling upon the folly of one miſerable woman. But a wandring habit is like a <hi>Libido vaga,</hi> the vile adulteries of looſer perſons that drink at every ciſtern that runs over, and ſtands open for them. For ſuch perſons have a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme habit, a habit of diſobedience, and may for want of opportunity or abilities, for want of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or by the influence of an impertinent humour be kept from acting always in one ſcene. But ſo long as they chooſe all that pleaſes them, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate no vice, but entertain the inſtances of many, their malice is habitual, their ſtate is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect averſation from God. For this is that which the Apoſtle cals, <hi>The body of ſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> a compagination of many parts and members; juſt as among the Lawyers, a flock, a people, a legion, are called bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: and <hi>corpus civitatis,</hi> we finde in <hi>Livy, corpus collegiorum</hi> in <hi>Caius, corpus regni</hi> in <hi>Virgil;</hi> and ſo here, this union of ſeveral ſins is <hi>the body of ſin,</hi> and that is, <hi>the body of death.</hi> And not onely he that feeds perpetually upon raw fruit puts himſelf into
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:115796:141"/>an ill habit of body; but he alſo does the ſame thing, who to day drinks too much, and to morrow fils himſelf with cold fruits, and the next day with condited muſhromes, and by evil orders and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs of diet, and accidental miſcarriages heaps up a multitude of cauſes, and unites them in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and cauſality of his death. This general diſorder is indeed longer doing, but it kils as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally and infallibly as a violent ſurfeit. And if a man dwels in the kingdome of ſin, it is all one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be ſick in one, or in twenty places; they are all but ſeveral rooms of the ſame <hi>Infirmatory,</hi> and ingredients of the ſame deadly poiſon. He that repeats his ſin, whether it be in one, or in ſeveral inſtances, ſtrikes himſelf often to the heart, with the ſame, or with ſeveral daggers.</p>
                  <p>Having thus premiſed what was neceſſary for the explication of the nature of vicious habits,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> we muſt conſider that of vicious habits there is a threefold capacity. 1. A natural. 2. A moral. 3. A relative, as it denominates a man in relation to God.</p>

It were not fit that we ſhould goe about to leſſen theſe inclinations to ſin, or to exterminate the remains of the old man, becauſe if they goe off, the difficulty being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, the reward muſt be no more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. It would alſo follow from hence, that the leſs men did delight in Gods ſervice, the more pleaſing they ſhould be to him: For if the relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctancy

                     <p n="4">4. It were not good to pray againſt entring into temptation; nay it were good we did tempt our ſelves, ſo we did not yield; to provoke our enemy, ſo he did not conquer us; to enter into danger, ſo we did not ſink under it; becauſe theſe increaſe the difficulty, and this increaſes the reward. All which being ſuch ſtrange and horrid conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, it follows undeniably, that the remanent portion of a vicious habit after the mans converſion is not the occaſion of a greater reward, is not good formally, is not good materially, but is a <hi>fomes,</hi> a neſt of concupiſcence, a bed of vipers, and the ſpawn of toads.</p>
                     <p>Now although this is not a ſin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> if it be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in its natural capacity, as it is the phyſical, unavoidable conſequent of actions (for an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quality may be conſidered without its appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evil) that is, though a Philoſopher may think and diſcourſe of it as of a natural production, and ſo without ſin, yet it does not follow from hence, that ſuch a habit, or inherent quality is without its proper ſin, or that its nature is innocent. But this is nothing elſe but to ſay, that a natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher does not conſider things in their moral capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. But juſt thus every ſin is innocent, and an act of adultery, or the begetting a child in fornication is good; a naturall Philoſopher looks on it as a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural action, applying proper actives to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion'd paſſives, and operating regularly, and by the way of nature. Thus we ſay God concurs to
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:115796:144"/>every ſin, that is, to the action in its natural capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that is therefore innocent ſo far; that is, if you conſider it without any relation to manners and laws, it is not unlawful. But then if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the whole action in its intire conſtitution, it is a ſin. And ſo is a ſinful habit, it is vicious and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal in its whole nature; and when the Queſtion is whether any thing be in its own capacity diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, good or bad; the anſwer muſt not be made by ſeparating the thing from all conſiderations of good and bad. However it will ſuffice, that a habit of vice in its natural capacity is no otherwiſe innocent then an act of adultery or drunkenneſs.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> A vicious habit hath in it this evil appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, that in every inſtant of its abode it keeps us out of Gods favour; we are in perpetual danger, and under the eternal arreſt of death, even without the actions of ſin, without pleaſure, or poſſeſſing any of its baſer intereſts. It was a horrible foolery which <hi>Appianus</hi> tels of <hi>Lentulus, Spinther,</hi> and <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>labella,</hi> that when <hi>Caeſar</hi> was killed in the <hi>Senate</hi> they drew their ſwords and ran about the ſtreets, as if they had done the fact, ſuppoſing it to be great and glorious: <hi>quibus gloriâ quidem frui non conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git, ſed poenas dederunt eaſdem cum ſontibus;</hi> they loſt their hopes of fame, but yet they were puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for the fact. So uſeleſs, and yet ſo pernicious a thing is a vicious habit; a man may pay the price of his luſt when he thinks not of it, and periſh for all that he was willing to enjoy, though he did not what he would. This is that by which Divines uſe to reconcile the juſtice of God with the infliction of eternal pains upon temporal and tranſitory acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There is in unrepenting or habitual ſinners an eternal ſpring or principle of evil, and they were ready for ever to have ſinned; and for this prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of minde to have ſinn'd for ever, it is by them affirm'd to be juſt to puniſh them for ever.

                     <p>The ſumme is this.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> If to love God, to delight in him, to frequent holy offices, to love his ſervice, to dwell in God, to have our converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, to lay up our treaſure, and our hopes, and our heart there, to have no thoughts, no deſigns, no imployment but for God and for religion, be more acceptable to God then to doe ſingle actions of a proſperous piety upon ſo many ſudden reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the ſtock of an alternate and returning duty: Then by the ſame reaſon is it infinitely more diſpleaſing to God to be a ſervant under Gods Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and our own, to be in ſlavery to ſin, ſubordinate to paſſion, rul'd by chance and company, to be weary of well doing, to delight in ſin according to the inner man; this I ſay, muſt be an infinite aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and averſion from God, a contradiction to all our hopes, and that in Theology ſignifies the ſame effect, as a vicious habit does in nature. For they are the ſame thing, and have onely different conceptions and formal notices; as the patience of <hi>Job</hi> differs from the patience of S. <hi>Laurence,</hi> as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural vertue, from the ſame grace in a Chriſtian: ſo does a natural habit of vice in its moral capacity differ from our averſion from God; I mean in the active ſenſe, which if it be not a diſtinct ſtate of ſinfulneſs, diſtinct from the guilt of ſinful actions, yet it is at leaſt a further degree of the ſame guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and being criminal; and either of them both doe ſufficiently evince the main queſtion. As the charity and devotion of <hi>Cornelius</hi> was increaſed by paſſing into a habit of theſe graces; and as the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of him a Jewiſh Proſelyte, the habitual piety was mended by his being a Chriſtian: So the ſingle
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:115796:149"/>actions of vice paſs a great guilt; but there is more contracted by the habitual vileneſs, and that habit is made worſe by being an oppoſition to, and an alienation from God. But of this I am now to give more ſpecial accounts.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> This is it that contains the ſtrictneſs of the main Queſtion: For a ſinful habit is a ſtate of ungraciouſneſs with God, and ſin is poſſeſſed of our love and choice. Therefore in vain it is to think a habit innocent, becauſe it is a natural product of many ſingle actions. Every proper action of the will is a natural production of the will; but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs voluntary. When the underſtanding hath practically determined the will, it is natural for the will to chooſe; but yet ſuch a choyce is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the will, and if it be not good, is reckoned as a ſin. So it is in vicious habits; they are natural effects of many ſingle actions; but then it is alſo to be remembred that their ſeat is <hi>the will,</hi> and whatſoever is naturally there, is voluntary ſtill. A habit of ſinning cannot remain at all, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and by delight, by love and adheſion. The ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is radicated no where but in the will, except it be by ſubordination, and in the way of miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. It follows therefore that every vicious habit is the prolongation of a ſin, a continuing to love that, which to love but once is death. For every one that hath a vicious habit, chooſes his ſin chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, acts it frequently, is ready to doe it in every opportunity, and at the call of every temptation; and according as theſe things are in every one, ſo is the degree of his habit. Now ſince every one
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:115796:150"/>of theſe which are the conſtituent parts of a habit, implies a readineſs and apt choyce of the will to ſin, it follows evidently that the capacity of a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habit by which it relates to God, conſiſting of ſo much evil, and all of it voluntary upon the ſtock of its own nature and conſtitution, is highly and chiefly, and diſtinctly ſinful. Although the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral facility, is naturally and unavoidably conſequent to frequent ſinful actions, yet it is alſo voluntary; for the habit is not contracted, nor can it remain but by our being willing to ſin, and delighting in the ways of error.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> Now if we look into the fountains of Scripture, which is admirable in the deſcription of vertue and vice, we ſhall finde that habitual ſin is all that evil which is to be avoided by all men that have in them the hopes of life. It is the prevailing of ſin, it is that by which ſins come to their height, it is the debauching of the will and underſtanding; it is all that which can be ſignified by thoſe great expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by which holy Scripture deſcribes thoſe great evils which God hates.

                     <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> But I conſider further. A ſingle act of ſin does not in all caſes denominate a man vicious. A man is not called a drunkard for having been once drunk, but for being often, for repeating the act, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing the affection. Every ſingle act provokes God to anger, but that anger can be as ſoon reſcinded as the act is paſt if it remains not by ſomething that
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:115796:151"/>is habitual. Indeed he is called a thief or an adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer that does one action of thoſe crimes; becauſe his conſent in ſuch things is great enough to equal a habit in leſſer things. The effect is notorious, the prohibition ſevere, the dangers infinite, the reaſons of them evident; they are <hi>peccata vaſtantia conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, &amp; quae uno actu perimunt,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, they kill with one blow, and therefore God exacts them highly, and men call the criminal by the name of the vice: But the action gives denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but in ſome caſes, but the habit in all. No man lives without ſin; and in the ſtate of regeneration, our infirmities ſtill preſs upon us, and make our hands ſhake, and our foot to ſtumble; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the enemy makes an inroad, and is preſently beaten out again, and though the good man reſolves againſt all, and contends againſt all,
<q>Pauca tamon ſuberunt priſcae veſtigia fraudis,</q> there will be ſomething for him to be humbled at, ſomthing to conteſt againſt, to keep him watchful and upon his guard. But if he be <hi>ebrioſus</hi> or <hi>petulans,</hi> if he be a drunkard, or wanton, an extortioner, or cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous; that is, if he have a habit of any ſin whatſoever, then he is not the ſon of God, but an heir of death and hell. That therefore which in all caſes denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates a man ſuch, both before God and before men, when the actions do not, that muſt needs have in it a proper malignity of its own, and that's the habit.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> This we may alſo ſee evidently in the matter of ſmaller ſins, &amp; the trifles of our life; which though they be often repeated, yet if they be kept aſunder by the interciſion of the actions of repentance, doe not diſcompoſe our ſtate of grace, but if they be habitual they doe, though it may be the ſingle inſtances by ſome accident being hindred do not ſo often return: and this is confeſſ'd on all hands.

A vicious habit is a principle of evil naturally and directly. And therefore as the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital ſins are worſe then others, becauſe they are an impure root, and apt to produce accurſed fruits; as covetouſneſs is the root of all evil; and pride, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and idolatry: ſo is every habit the mother of evil, not accidentally, and by chance, but by its proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy and natural germination, <hi>and therefore is worſe then ſingle actions.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> If natural concupiſcence hath in it the nature of ſin, and needs a laver of regeneration, and the blood of Chriſt to waſh it off, much more ſhall our habitual and acquir'd concupiſcence. For this is much worſe, procur'd by our own act, introduc'd by our conſent, brought upon us by the wrath of God which we have deſerv'd; ſpringing from the baſeneſs of our own manners, the conſequent of our voluntary diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. So that if it were unreaſonable that our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural concupiſcence ſhould be charged upon us as criminal as being involuntary; yet for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it is moſt reaſonable that our habitual ſins, our ſuperinduc'd concupiſcence ſhould be imputed to us as criminal, becauſe it is voluntary in its cauſe which is in us, and is voluntary in the effect, that is, it is delighted in, &amp; ſeated in the will.

The firſt is like an offending ſervant who deſerves to be thrown away; but in a vicious habit there is an antipathy: The Man is Gods enemy, as a Wolf to the Lamb, as the Hyaena to the Dog. He that commits a ſingle ſin, hath ſtain'd his skin, and thrown dirt upon it; but an habitual ſinner is an Ethiop,

Thus a man may be a Perſecutor, or a Murtherer, if he have a heart ready to do it: and if a luſtful ſoul be an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſs, becauſe the deſire is a ſin, it follows that the habit is a particular ſtate of ſin diſtinct from the act, becauſe it is a ſtate of vicious deſires. And as a body may be ſaid to be luſtful though it be aſleep, or eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, without the ſenſe of actual urtications and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, by reaſon of its conſtitution: ſo may the ſoul by the reaſon of its habit, that is, its vicious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and baſe effect of ſin be hated by God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd upon that account.</p>
                     <p>So that a habit is not onely diſtinct from its acts in the manner of being,

<pb n="254" facs="tcp:115796:153"/>ſhould periſh, which was affirmed by the Phariſees of old: and then we were to live or die by chance and opportunity, by actions and not by the will, by the outward and not by the inward man; then there could be no ſuch thing neceſſary as the <hi>Kingdome of Grace,</hi> Chriſts <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> in the ſoul; then we can belong to <hi>God</hi> without belonging to his <hi>Kingdome;</hi> and we might be in God, though the Kingdome of God were not in us. For without this we might do many ſingle actions of vertue, and it might happen that theſe might be more then the ſingle actions of ſin, even though the habit and affection and ſtate of ſin remain. Now if the caſe may be ſo (as in the particular inſtance) that the mans final condition ſhal not be determin'd by ſingle actions, it muſt be by habits, and ſtates and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of actions: and therefore theſe muſt have in them a proper good and bad reſpectively by which the man ſhall be judg'd, diſtinct from the actions by which he ſhall not (in the preſent caſe) be judg'd. All which conſiderations being put together, do unanſwerably put us upon this concluſion: That a habit of ſin is that ſtate of evil by which we are enemies to God and ſlaves of Satan, by which we are ſtrangers from the Covenant of Grace, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to the portion of Devils: and therefore as a Corollary of all, we are bound under pain of a new ſin to riſe up inſtantly after every fall, to repent ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily for every ſin, not to let the Sun go down upon our wrath, nor riſe upon our luſt, nor run his courſe upon our covetouſneſs or ambition. For not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every period of impenitence is a period of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and eternal death may enter; but it is an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of our folly, a continuing to provoke God, a further aberration from the rule, a departure from life, it is a growing in ſin, a progreſſion towards final impenitence, to obduration and Apoſtaſie, it is
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:115796:153"/>a tempting God, and a deſpiſing of his grace, it is all the way preſumption, and a dwelling in ſin by delight and obedience; that is, it is a conjugation of new evils, and new degrees of evil. As pertinacy makes error to be hereſie, and impenitence makes little ſins unite and become deadly, and perſeverance cauſes good to be crowned, and evil to be unpardonable: So is the habit of viciouſneſs, the confirmation of our danger, and ſolennities of death, the inveſtiture and ſecurity of our horrible inheritance.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme is this.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> Every ſingle ſin is a high cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, it is a ſhame and it is a danger, in one inſtant it makes us liable to Gods ſevere anger. But a vicious habit is a conjugation of many actions, every one of which is highly damnable, and beſides that union which is formally an aggravation of the evils, there is ſuperinduc'd upon the will and all its miniſtring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, a viciouſneſs and pravity which makes evil to be belov'd and choſen, and God to be hated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpis'd. A vicious habit hath in it all the Phyſical, Metaphyſical and Moral degrees of which it can be capable. For there is not onely a not repenting, a not reſcinding of the paſt act by a contrary nolition; but there is a continuance in it, and a repetition of the ſame cauſe of death, as if a man ſhould marry death, the ſame death ſo many times over: it is an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of our ſhame, a taking it upon us, an owning and a ſecuring our deſtruction, and before a man can arrive thither, he muſt have broken all the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his reſtitution in pieces, and for his reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very nothing is left, unleſs a <hi>Palladium</hi> fall from heaven; the man cannot live again, unleſs God ſhall do more for him then he did for <hi>Lazarus</hi> when he raiſed him from the dead.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis is the moſt material and practical difficulty of the Queſtion:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> for upon this depends the moſt myſterious article of Repentance, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of dying penitents. For if a habit is not to be pardoned without the extirpation of that which is vicious, and the ſuperinducing its contrary; this being a work of time, requires a particular grace of God, and much induſtry, caution, watchfulneſs, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent prayers, many advices and conſultations, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, ſevere application: and is of ſo great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and ſuch ſlow progreſſion, that all men who have had experience of this imployment, and have heartily gone about to cure a vicious habit, know it is not a thing to be done upon our death-bed. That therefore which I intend to prove, I expreſs in this Propoſition.</p>
                  <q>A vicious habit is not to be pardon'd without the introduction of the contrary, either in kinde, or in perfect affection, and in all thoſe inſtances in which the man hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to work.</q>
                  <p>The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> whoſe Chairs and Pulpits are dangerous guides in the article of Repentance, affirms, that any ſin, or any habit of ſin may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:115796:154"/>by any ſingle act of contrition; the continued ſin of fourty years may be waſh'd off in leſs then fourty minutes, nay by an act of attrition with the Prieſtly abſolution: which propoſition, if it be falſe, does deſtroy the intereſt of ſouls; and it cannot be true, becauſe it deſtroys the intereſt of piety, and the neceſſities of a good life. The reproof of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon many propoſitions, of which I ſhall give as plain accounts as the thing will bear.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Every habit of vice may be expelled by a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of vertue naturally, as injuſtice by juſtice, glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by temperance, luſt by chaſtity: but by theſe it is not meritoriouſly remitted and forgiven; becauſe nothing <hi>in nature</hi> can remit ſins, or be the immediate <hi>natural diſpoſition</hi> to pardon. All this is the gift of God, a grace obtain'd by our holy Redeemer, the price of his bloud; but in this, the caſe is all one as it is in the greateſt innocence of the beſt of men, which if it be not allowed by incorporation into Chriſt, and ſanctified by faith, wants its proper title to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: and ſo it is with Repentance. For nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teach us this leſſon, much leſs make it acceptable. For it depending wholly upon Gods graciouſneſs and free forgiveneſs, can be taught onely by him, by whom it is effectual, and this is conveyed to us by our bleſſed Lord, according to that ſaying, <hi>Grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Although a habit cannot be the meritorious cauſe of pardoning the contrary habit, yet to him that hath contracted a vicious habit, it is neceſſary in order to his pardon that he root out that habit and obtain the contrary in ſome degrees of prevalency, ſo that the ſcales be turned on that ſide where is the intereſt of vertue: and this depends upon the evidence of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer propoſition. If to be an habitual ſinner be more then to be guilty of thoſe actual ſins by w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the habit was contracted: then as it is neceſſary to reſcind the act
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:115796:155"/>of ſin by an act of contrition and repentance: ſo alſo it is as neceſſary that the habit be retracted by a habit, that every wound may have its balſam, and every broken bone be bound up and redintegrate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> But in the caſe of habitual ſins the argument is more preſſing. For if the act which is paſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains not, yet muſt be reverſed by its contrary, much rather muſt that be taken off which does remain, which actually tempts us, by which we are in a ſtate exactly contrary to the ſtate of grace. For ſome ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome acts of ſin and in trifling inſtances may ſtand with the ſtate of holineſs, and be incident to a good man: but no vicious habit can, neither in a ſmall matter, nor in a great; this is an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a deſtroyer,</hi> and therefore as it hath a particular obliquity, ſo it muſt have a ſpecial repentance, a repentance proper to it, that is, as an act reſcinds an act, ſo muſt a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit be oppos'd to a habit, a ſingle act of contrition to a ſingle ſin, and therefore it muſt be more, no leſs then a laſting and an habitual contrition to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon for the habit. And although a habit can meritoriouſly remit a habit, no more then an act can do an act, they being both equal as to that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, yet they are alſo diſpoſitions equally (at leaſt on this hand) neceſſary for the obtaining pardon of their reſpective contraries.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> It is confeſſed on all ſides, that every ſingle ſin which we remember, muſt be repented of by an act of repentance that muſt particularly touch that ſin; if we diſtinctly remember it, it muſt diſtinctly be revok'd by a nolition, a ſorrow, and moral revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Since therefore every habit is contracted by many ſingle actions, every one of which if they were ſinful muſt ſome way or other be reſcinded by its contrary, the reſciſſion of thoſe will alſo intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a contrary habit, and ſo the queſtion will be evinc'd upon that account. For if we ſhall think one
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:115796:155"/>act of ſorrow can aboliſh many foul acts of ſin, we but deceive our ſelves; we muſt have many for one (as I have already made to appear) a multitude of ſighs and prayers againſt every foul action that we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and then the conſequent is plain, that upon this reckoning when a habit is contracted, the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which were its principle cannot be reſcinded but by ſuch Repentances which will extinguiſh not onely the formality, but the material and natural effect of that curſed production, at leaſt in very many degrees.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> A habit oppos'd to a habit hath greater ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then an act oppos'd to an act, and therefore is not onely equally requiſite, but the more proper remedy and inſtance of repentance. For an act of it ſelf cannot naturally extinguiſh <hi>the guilt,</hi> nor meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly obtain its <hi>pardon:</hi> but neither can it deſtroy its <hi>natural being,</hi> which was not permanent, and therefore not to be wrought upon by an <hi>after act.</hi> But to oppoſe a habit to a habit, can equally in the merits of Chriſt be the diſpoſition to a pardon, as an act can for an act; and is certainly much better then any one act can be, becauſe it includes many ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle acts of the ſame nature, and it is all of them, and their permanent effect and change wrought by them beſides. So that it is certainly the better and the ſurer way. But now the Queſtion is not, whether it be the better way, but whether it be neceſſary, and will not the leſſer way ſuffice? To this therefore I anſwer, that ſince no man can be acceptable to God as long as ſin reigns in his mortal body, and ſince either ſin muſt reign, or the Spirit of Chriſt muſt reign; for a man cannot be a Neuter in this war; it is neceſſary that ſins kingdome be deſtroyed and broken, and that Chriſt rule in our hearts; that is, it is neceſſary that the firſt and the old habits be taken off and new ones introduc'd. For although the moral revocation
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:115796:156"/>of a <hi>ſingle act</hi> may be a ſufficient diſpoſition to its pardon, becauſe <hi>the act</hi> was tranſient, and unleſs there be a habit or ſomething of it, nothing remains: yet the moral revocation of a ſinful habit cannot be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, becauſe there is impreſſed upon the ſoul a viciouſneſs and contrariety to God, which muſt be taken off, or there can be no reconciliation. For let it be but conſidered, that a vicious habit is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent averſation from God, <hi>an evil heart,</hi> the <hi>evil treaſure of the heart, a carnall mindedneſs,</hi> an union and principle of ſins; and then let it be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, whether a man who is in this ſtate can be a friend of God, or reconcil'd to him in his Son, who lives in a ſtate ſo contrary to his holy Spirit of Grace. The guilt cannot be taken off without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying its nature, ſince the nature it ſelf is a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and corruption.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> Either it is neceſſary to extirpate and break the habit, or elſe a man may be pardon'd while he is in love with ſin. For every vicious habit being radicated in the will, and being a ſtrong love, inclination and adheſion to ſin, unleſs the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural being of this habit be taken off, the enmity againſt God remains. For it being a quality perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and inherent, and its nature being an aptneſs and eaſineſs, a deſire to ſin and longing after it, to retract this by a moral retractation, and not by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural alſo, is but hypocriſie: for no man can ſay tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I hate the ſin I have committed, ſo long as the love to ſin is inherent in his will; and then if God ſhould pardon ſuch a perſon, it would be to juſtifie a ſinner remaining ſuch, which God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually hates as to condemne the innocent: <hi>He will by no means acquit the guilty.</hi> It was part of his Name which he cauſed to be proclaimed in the Camp of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And if this could be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, a man might be in the ſtate of ſin,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:115796:156"/>and the ſtate of grace at the ſame time; which hitherto all Theology hath believ'd to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> This whole Queſtion is clear'd by a large diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> For having under the perſon of an unregenerate man complain'd of the habitual ſtate of prevailing ſin, of one who is a ſlave to ſin,

That being the evil he complains of, and of which he ſeeks remedy, that is to be remov'd. But that we may well underſtand to what ſenſe, and in what degree this is to be done; in the next periods he deſcribes the contrary ſtate of deliverance, by the parts and characters of an habit or ſtate of holineſs; which he cals, <hi>a walking after the Spirit,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſince we ſay our nature is inclined to ſin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> and we feel it to be ſo in many inſtances, and yet that it needs time and progreſſion to get a habit of that whither we too naturally tend; we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to apprehend that we need time and fierce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, and the long ſuffering of violences to take <hi>the kingdome of heaven by force,</hi> by a ſtate of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and hoſtility againſt the tempting enemy. It is much harder to get a habit againſt our nature, and a prepoſſeſſing habit, then to confirm nature, and to actuate our inclinations.</p>
                  <p>And this does not onely relate to habits in their <hi>Natural capacity,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> but in their <hi>Moral,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently their <hi>Relative capacity,</hi> as appertaining to God, in the matter of his valuation of them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in habits as it is in acts, although metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally we can diſtinguiſh the action from the irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, yet becauſe they are ſubjected in the ſame perſon, and the irregularity is inherent in the action, in the whole compoſition the action is ſinful; ſo it is in habits. For the ſin adheres to the natural fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility, and follows it in all its capacities. And as the <hi>natural facility</hi> of doing viciouſly, is cured by time, and a ſucceſſive continued diligence; ſo is <hi>the ſinful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
                     <pb n="265" facs="tcp:115796:158"/>becauſe that <hi>facility</hi> is vicious and <hi>ſinful.</hi> And as heat is diſtinguiſhed from fire, but you cannot leſſen the heat, but by decreaſing the natural being of fire: ſo does the ſin of a vicious habit paſs away as the habit naturally leſſens; that is, the Moral ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity changes as does the Natural, this being the ſubject of that, and it could not have been this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, if it had not in it this ſinfulneſs. *</p>
                  <p>Now if the parts of this argument be put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> their intention is this. A habit of ſin is not gotten but by time and progreſſion; and yet it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be loſt ſo ſoon as it was gotten; but it is a long time before its <hi>natural being</hi> is overcome by its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But <hi>the ſinfulneſs</hi> of it does paſs away with <hi>the natural being;</hi> and no otherwiſe; therefore the ſinfulneſs of it cannot be removed ſuddenly. And therefore if mortification be a duty, and we be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to doe it, we are commanded to doe a long work and a difficult, a thing that is more then the moral retractation of it by a ſingle act of ſorrow or contrition, a duty that contains in it ſo much work as is proportion'd to the neceſſity, even to the breaking the habit of ſin, and ſetting up the habit of vertue over it. Now then, all the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will be, whether Mortification be a Precept, or a Counſel. Concerning which, I onely appeal to the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi>

                     <hi>He that is dead is juſtified from ſins,</hi> not till then, not till his habit was dead; not as ſoon as he morally retracts it by an act of diſpleaſure and contrition, but when the ſin is dead, when the habit is crucified, when the concupiſcence does not reign, but is overcome in all its former prevalencies, then he is pardon'd, and not before.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> Unleſs it be neceſſary to oppoſe a habit againſt a habit, a ſtate of vertue againſt a ſtate of vice; that is, if a vicious habit may be pardon'd upon one act of contrition, then it may ſo happen that a man ſhall not be obliged to doe good, but onely to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from evil, to ceaſe from ſin, but not to proceed and grow in grace: which is againſt the perpetual deſign, and analogy of the Goſpel, and the nature of Evangelical righteouſneſs, which differs from the righteouſneſs of the law, as doing good from not doing evil.

                  <p>Now then,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> to apply this to the preſent argument. Suppoſe a vicious perſon who hath liv'd an impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life, plac'd upon his death-bed, exhorted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, made ſenſible of his danger, invited by the Sermons of his Prieſt to dreſs his ſoul with duty and ſorrow; if he obeys, and is ſorry for his ſin; ſuppoſing that this ſorrow does really begin that part of his duty which conſiſts in not ſinning, nay, ſuppoſe he will never ſin again (which is the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of the law) yet how can he in that caſe doe that good which is required by the Goſpel? <hi>Seek the kingdome of heaven, and the righteouſneſs thereof.</hi> The Goſpel hath a peculiar righteouſneſs of its own, proper to it ſelf, without which there is no entrance into heaven. But <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law</hi> is called <hi>our own righteouſneſs,</hi> that is, ſuch a righteouſneſs which men by nature know; for we all by the innate law of nature, know that we ought to abſtain from doing injury to Man, from impiety to God: But we onely know by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation the righteouſneſs of the kingdome which conſiſts in holineſs and purity, chaſtity, and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, humility, and ſelf-denial. He that reſts in the firſt, and thinks he may be ſav'd by it (as S. <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſion is) <hi>he eſtabliſheth his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> that is, <hi>the righteouſneſs of the law,</hi> and this he does, whoſoever thinks that his evil habits are pardon'd without doing that good, and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:115796:160"/>thoſe graces which conſtitute the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Goſpel, that is, faith and holineſs, which are the ſignifications, and the vital parts of the new creature.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> But becauſe this doctrine is highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and the very ſoul of Chriſtianity, I conſider further, that without the ſuperinducing a contrary ſtate of good to the former ſtate of evil, we cannot return, or go off from that evil condition that God hates, I mean the middle ſtate, or the ſtate of <hi>luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs.</hi> For though all the old philoſophy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that vertue and vice had no <hi>medium</hi> between them, but whatſoever was not evil, was good, and he that did not doe evil was a good man, ſaid the old Jews, yet this they therefore did unreprovably teach, becauſe they knew not this ſecret of the righteouſneſs of God. For in the <hi>Evangelical</hi> juſtice, between <hi>the natural, or legal good or evil</hi> there is a <hi>medium</hi> or a third, which of it ſelf, and by the accounts of the Law was not evil, but in the accounts of the Evangelical righteouſneſs is a very great one; that is, <hi>lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> or a <hi>cold, tame, indifferent, unactive religion.</hi> Not that <hi>lukewarmneſs</hi> is by name forbidden by any of the laws of the Goſpel, but that it is againſt the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy and deſign of it. A lukewarm perſon does not do evil, but he is hated by God, becauſe he does not vigorouſly proceed in godlineſs. No law condemnes him, but the Goſpel approves him not, becauſe he does not <hi>from the heart obey this form of doctrine,</hi> which commands a <hi>courſe,</hi> a <hi>habit,</hi> a <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>life</hi> of holineſs. It is not enough that we abſtain from evil, we ſhall not be crowned unleſs we be <hi>partakers of a Divine nature.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> For to this S. <hi>Peter</hi> enjoyns us carefully. Now then we <hi>partake of a Divine nature,</hi> when <hi>the Spirit dwels in us,</hi> and rules all our faculties, when we are united unto God, when we imitate the Lord Jeſus, when we are perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:115796:160"/>Now whether this can be done by an act of contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, needs no further inquiry, but to obſerve the nature of Evangelical Righteouſneſs, the hatred God bears to lukewarmneſs, the perfection he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of a Chriſtian, the deſign and great example of our bleſſed Lord, the glories of that inheritance whither we are deſign'd, and of the obtaining of which, obedience to God in the faith of Jeſus Chriſt is made the onely indiſpenſable, neceſſary condition.</p>
                  <p>For let it be conſidered.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> Suppoſe a man that is righteous according to the letter of the Law, of the Ten Commandements, all of which (two excepted) were Negative; this man hath liv'd innocently and harmleſly all his days, but yet uſeleſly, unprofitably, in reſt and unactive circumſtances; is not this perſon an unprofitable ſervant? The ſervant in the Parable was juſt ſuch: he ſpent not his Maſters talent with riotous living, like the Prodigal, but laid it up in a Napkin, he did neither good nor harm; but becauſe he did no good, he receiv'd none, but was thrown into outer darkneſs.

And thus to this very day do we.

                  <p>Now if this be true in one period,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> it is true in all the periods of our life.

For if the moſt innocent by the legal righteouſneſs is ſtill but unprofitable, much more is he ſuch who hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicated that and liv'd vilely, and now in his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment begins to enter that ſtate, which if it goes no further is ſtill unprofitable.

                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> BUt why may not all this be done in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant by the grace of God? Cannot he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe into us the habits of all the graces Evangelical? Faith cannot be obtained by natural means, and if it be procur'd by ſupernatural, the Spirit of God is not retarded by the meaſures of an enemy, and the
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115796:162"/>dull methods of natural oppoſition. <hi>Neſcit tarda molimina Spiritus ſancti gratia.</hi> Without the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace we cannot work any thing of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of God; but if he gives us his grace, does not he make us chaſte and patient, humble and devout, and all in an inſtant? For thus the main Queſtion ſeems to be confeſſed and granted, that a habit is not remitted but by the introduction of the contrary: but when you conſider what you handle, it is a cloud and nothing elſe; for this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the neceſſity of a habit, enjoyns no more labour nor care, it requires no more time, it intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces no active fears, and infers no particular cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and implies the doing of no more then to the remiſſion of a ſingle act of one ſin.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> that the grace of God is a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural principle, and gives new aptneſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, powers and poſſibilities, it invites and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, it ſupplies us with arguments, and anſwers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, it brings us into artificial neceſſities, and inclines us ſweetly: and this is the <hi>ſemen Dei</hi> ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by S. <hi>John, the ſeed of God</hi> thrown into the furrows of our hearts, ſpringing up (unleſs we choke it) to life eternal. By theſe aſſiſtances we being helped can do our duty, and we can expel the habits of vice, and get the habits of vertue: But as we cannot doe Gods work without Gods grace; ſo Gods grace does not do our work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us. For grace being but the beginnings of a new nature in us, gives nothing but powers and inclinations. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our infirmities;</hi> ſo S. <hi>Paul</hi> explicates this myſtery.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.26.</note> And therefore when he had ſaid, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am;</hi> that is, all is owing to his grace: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo addes, <hi>I have baboured more then they all, yet not I;</hi> that is, not I alone; <hi>ſed gratia Dei me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum; the grace of God that is with me.</hi> For
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:115796:163"/>the grace of God <hi>ſtands at the door and knocks;</hi> but we muſt attend to his voice, and <hi>open the door, and then he will enter and ſup with us, and we ſhall be with him.</hi> The grace of God is like a graff put into a ſtock of another nature; it makes uſe of the faculties and juice of the ſtock and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral root, but converts all into its own nature. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> We may as well ſay there can be a habit born with us, as infus'd into us. For as a natural ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit ſuppoſes a frequency of action by him who hath naturall abilities; ſo an infus'd habit (if there were any ſuch) is a reſult and conſequent of a frequent doing the works of the Spirit. So that to ſay that God in an inſtant infuſes into us a habit [of Chaſtity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] is to ſay that he hath in an inſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd into us to have done the acts of that grace fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. For it is certain by experience, that the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent doing the actions of any grace, increaſes the grace, and yet the grace or aids of Gods Spirit are as neceſſary for the growth, as for the beginnings of grace. We cannot either will or do without his help; he worketh both in us, that is, we by his help alone are enabled to do things above our nature. But then we are the perſons enabled; and therefore we do theſe works as we do others, not by the ſame powers, but in the ſame manner.</p>
                  <p>When God raiſes a Cripple from his couch,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> and gives him ſtrength to move, though the aid be ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, yet the motion is after the manner of nature. And it is evident in the matter of faith, which though it be the gift of God, yet it is ſeated in the Underſtanding, which operates by way of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, &amp; not by intuition: The believer underſtands as a Man, not as an Angel: And when Chriſt by miracle reſtor'd a blinde eye, ſtill that eye did ſee by reception, or elſe by emiſſion of ſpecies, juſt
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:115796:163"/>ſo as eyes that did ſee naturally. So it is in habits. For it is a contradiction to ſay that a perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit is infus'd in an inſtant: For if a habit were infus'd, it muſt be infus'd as a habit is acquir'd; for elſe it is not a habit.
<note place="margin">

                  <p>But this device of <hi>infus'd habits,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> is a fancy without ground, and without ſenſe, without au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, or any juſt grounds of confidence, and it hath in it very bad effects. For it deſtroys all neceſſity of our care and labour in the wayes of godlineſs, all cautions of a holy life; it is apt to miniſter pretences and excuſes for a perpetually wicked life till the laſt of our dayes, making men to truſt to a late Repentance; it puts men upon vain confidences, and makes them relie for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon dreams and empty notions; it deſtroys all the duty of man, and cuts off all entercourſe of obedience and reward. But it is ſufficient, that there is no ground for it in Scripture, nor in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, nor in right Reaſon: but it is infinitely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of all that wiſe conduct of Souls, by which God would glorifie himſelf by the means of a free obedience; and it is infinitely confuted by all thoſe Scriptures which require our cooperation with the aſſiſtance of Gods holy Spirit. For all the helps that the Spirit of Grace miniſters to us, is farre from doing our work for us, that it onely enables us to do it for our ſelves, and makes it reaſonable that God ſhould therefore exact it of us, becauſe we have no excuſe, and cannot plead diſability. To which purpoſe that diſcourſe of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is highly convincing and demonſtrative: <hi>Work out your own ſalvation with fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
<note place="margin">Phil. 2.12, 13.</note> for it is God which worketh in you both to

                  <p>Obj. 2.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> But if a ſingle act of contrition cannot procure pardon of ſins that are habitual, then a wicked man that returns not till it be too late to root out vicious habits, muſt deſpair of ſalvation. I anſwer, That ſuch a man ſhould doe well to ask his Phyſician whether it be poſſible for him to eſcape that ſickneſs? If his Phyſician ſay it is, then the man need not deſpair; for if he return to life and health, it will not be too late for him by the grace of God to recover in his ſoul. But if his Phyſician ſay he cannot recover; firſt let the Phyſician be reproved for making his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to deſpair. I am ſure he hath leſs reaſon to ſay he cannot live, then there is to ſay, ſuch a perſon hath no promiſe that he ſhall be ſaved without performing the condition. But the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician if he be a wiſe man will ſay, So farre as he underſtands by the rules of his art, this man cannot recover; but ſome ſecret cauſes of things there are, or may be, by which the event may be better then the moſt reaſonable predictions of his art. The ſame anſwer I deſire may be taken in the Queſtion of his ſoul. Concerning which the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate is to preach the rules and meaſures of God, but not to give a reſolution concerning the ſecret and final ſentence. 2. The caſe of the five fooliſh Virgins, if we may conſtrue it as it is expreſſed, gives a ſad account to ſuch perſons: and unleſs that part of the Parable be inſignificant, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes their ſorrow, their diligence, their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, their begging of oyle, their going out to buy oyle before the Bridegroom came, but after it was noiſed that he was coming, and the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of all this, we may too certainly conclude, that much more then a ſingle act of contrition, and a moral revocation, that is, a ſorrow and a nolition of the paſt ſins, may be done upon our
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:115796:165"/>death-bed without effect, without a being accepted to pardon and ſalvation. 3. When things are come to that ſad ſtate, let the man hope as much as he can; God forbid that I ſhould be Author to him to deſpair. The purpoſe of this diſcourſe is, that men in health ſhould not put things to that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate condition, or make their hopes ſo little and afflicted, that it may be diſputed whether they be alive or no. 4. But this objection is nothing but a temptation and a ſnare; a device to make me confeſs that the former arguments <hi>(for fear men ſhould deſpair)</hi> ought to be anſwered, and are not perfectly convincing. I intended them onely for inſtitution and inſtruction, not to confute any perſon or any thing, but to condemne ſin, and to reſoue men from danger. But truly, I doe think they are rightly concluding (as moral propoſitions are capable;) and if the conſequent of them be, that dying perſons after a vicious life cannot hope <hi>(or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily)</hi> for pardon, I am truly ſorrowful that any man ſhould fall into that ſad ſtate of things; as I am really afflicted and ſorrowful that any man ſhould live vilely, or periſh miſerably; but then it ought not to be imputed to this doctrine that it makes men deſpair, for the purpoſe and proper conſequent of it, is, that men are warned to live ſo, that they may be ſecur'd in their hopes, that is, that men <hi>give diligence to make their calling and election ſure,</hi> that they may take no deſperate cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and fall into no deſperate condition. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if any man preach the neceſſity of a good life, and of actual obedience, he may as well be charged to drive men to deſpair; for the ſumme of the foregoing doctrine is nothing elſe, but that it is neceſſary we ſhould walk before God <hi>in all holy converſation and godlineſs.</hi> But of this I ſhall give a large account in the fifth §.</p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="tcp:115796:165"/>
                  <p>Obj. 3. But if things be thus, it is not good or ſafe to be a criminal Judge, and all the Diſcipline of Warre will be unlawful and highly diſpleaſing to God. For if any one be taken in an act of a great ſin, and as it happens in War, be put to death ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, without leiſure and ſpace of repentance, by the meaſures of this doctrine, the man ſhall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and conſequently the power by which he fals is uncharitable.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer; That in an act of ſin the caſe is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then in an habit, as I have already demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in its proper place: It muſt be a habit that muſt extirpate a habit; but an act is reſcinded by a leſs violence and abode of duty: and it is poſſible for an act of duty to be ſo heroical, or the repentance of an hour to be ſo pungent and dolorous, and the fruits of that repentance putting forth by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den warmths and fervour of the ſpirit, be ſo good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and fair, as through the mercies of God in Jeſus Chriſt, to obtain pardon of that ſingle ſin, if that be all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But it is to be conſidered, whether the man be otherwiſe a vicious perſon, or was he a good man, but by misfortune and careleſneſs overtaken in a fault? If he was a good man, his ſpirit is ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to good, that he is ſoon brought to an excellent ſorrow, and to his former ſtate, eſpecially being awakened by the ſad arreſt of a haſty death: and if he accepts that death willingly, making that which is neceſſarily inforc'd upon him, to become voluntary by his acceptation of it, changing the judgement into penance, I make no queſtion but he ſhall finde mercy. But if the man thus taken in a fault was otherwiſe a vicious perſon, it is another conſideration. It is not ſafe for him to goe to war; but the Officers may as charitably and juſtly put ſuch a perſon to death for a fault, as ſend him upon
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115796:166"/>a hard ſervice. The doing of his duty may as well ruine him, as the doing of a fault; and if he be repriev'd a week, he will finde difficulty in the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he ſhould, and danger enough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The diſcipline of war, if it be onely admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred where it is neceſſary, not onely in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule, but alſo in the particular inſtance, cannot be reprov'd upon this account. Becauſe by the laws of warre ſufficiently publiſhed, every man is ſufficiently warned of his danger; which if he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accept, or be bound to accept, he periſhes by his own fault, if he periſhes at all. For as by the hazard of his imployment he is ſufficiently called upon to repent worthily of all his evil life paſt, ſo is he by the ſame hazardous imployment, and the known laws of war, caution'd to beware of commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any great ſin: and if his own danger will not become his ſecurity, then his confidence may be his ruine, and then nothing is to be blam'd but himſelf.</p>
                  <p>4. But yet it were highly to be wiſh'd, that when ſuch caſes do happen, and that it can be permitted in the particular without the diſſolution of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, ſuch perſons ſhould be pitied in order to their eternal intereſt. But when it cannot, the Miniſter of juſtice, is the Miniſter of God, and diſpenſes his power by the rules of his juſtice, at which we cannot quarrel, though he cuts off ſinners in their acts of ſin, of which he hath given them ſufficient warning, and hath a long time expected their amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: to whom that of <hi>Seneca</hi> may be applied, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>num bonum tibi ſupereſt, repraeſentabimus mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</hi> Nothing but death will make ſome men ceaſe to ſin; and therefore, <hi>quo uno modo poſſunt, deſinant mali eſſe.</hi> God puts a period to the increaſe of their ruine and calamity, by making that wickedneſs
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:115796:166"/>ſhorter, which if it could would have been eternal. When men are incorrigible, they may be cut off in charity as well as juſtice; and therefore as it is always juſt, ſo it is ſometimes pity, though a ſad one, to take a ſinner away with his ſins upon his head. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="280" facs="tcp:115796:167"/>is certain, and in its meaſure acceptable to God, and effective of all its proper purpoſes.

                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> But a man is not of a contrite heart as ſoon as he hath exerciſed one act of <hi>contrition.</hi> He that goes to break a rock, does ſomething towards it by every blow, but every blow does not break it.

Repentance alone is not ſufficient; There muſt be faith, and hope, and charity; therefore much leſs ſhall a part be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, when the whole is not.

                  <p>But one thing I ſhall remark before I leave this. In the definition of Contrition, all the Schools of <hi>Theology</hi> in the world that I know of, put <hi>the love of God. Contrition</hi> is not onely <hi>ſorrow,</hi> but a <hi>love of God</hi> too. Now this doctrine, if they themſelves would give men leave rightly to underſtand it, is not onely an excellent doctrine, but will alſo do the whole buſineſs of this great Queſtion. Without <hi>Contrition</hi> our ſins cannot be pardon'd. It is not <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,</hi> unleſs the <hi>love of God</hi> be in it. Adde then but theſe; Our <hi>love to God</hi> does not conſiſt in an act of <hi>intuition</hi> or <hi>contemplation,</hi> nor yet directly and meerly of <hi>paſſion;</hi> but it conſiſts in <hi>obedience.

                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/> But now to the inſtances of <hi>David</hi> and the Prodigal, and the ſudden pronunciation of their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, there is ſomething particular to be ſaid. The Parable of the Prodigal can prove nothing but Gods readineſs to receive every returning ſinner: but neither the meaſures nor the times of pardon are there deſcribed. As for <hi>David,</hi> his pardon was
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:115796:170"/>pronounced ſuddenly, but it was but a piece of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; the ſentence of death which by <hi>Moſes law</hi> he incurred, that onely was remitted: but after this pardon, <hi>David</hi> repented bitterly in ſackcloth and aſhes, he faſted and prayed, he liv'd holily and wiſely, he made amends as he could; and yet the childe died that was born to him, his Son and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects rebelled, his Concubines were diſhonoured in the face of the Sun, and the Sword never departed from his houſe. 2. But to both theſe and all other inſtances that are or can be of the like nature, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That there is no doubt but Gods pardon is as early and ſpeedy as the beginnings of our repentance; but then it is ſuch a pardon as is proportionable to the Repentance, <hi>a beginning Pardon,</hi> to <hi>a beginning Repentance.</hi> It is one degree of pardon to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Repentance; To have more grace given, to have hopes of final abſolution, to be continued in the work of the Lord, to be help'd in the mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of our ſins, to be invited forwards, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and defended, and bleſſed, ſtill are further progreſſions of it, and anſwer to the ſeveral parts and perſeverance of Repentance. And in this ſenſe thoſe ſayings of the old Doctors are true, but in no other that I know of. To this purpoſe they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent words which were ſpoken by S. <hi>Auſtin,

But againſt this doctrine are pretended ſome ſentences of the Fathers, expreſly affirming that a ſinner returning to God in any inſtant may be pardoned; even in the laſt moment of his life, when it is certain nothing can be done, but ſingle acts of
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:115796:170"/>contrition or ſomething like it. Thus the Author of the book <hi>De coena Domini,</hi> attributed to S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Sed &amp; in eodem articulo temporis cum jam anima feſtinat ad exitum, &amp; egrediens ad labia expirantis emerſerit, poenitentiam clementiſſimi Dei benignitas non aſpernatur: nec ſerum eſt quod verum, nec irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſibile quod voluntarium, &amp; quaecunque neceſſitas cogat ad poenitudinem, nec quantitas criminis, nec bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas temporis, nec horae extremitas, nec vitae enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, ſi vera contritio, ſi pura fuerit voluptatum muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, excludit à veniâ, ſed in amplitudine ſinus ſui mater charitas prodigos ſuſcipit revertentes, &amp; ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lit nolit Novatus haereticus omni tempore Dei gratia re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipit poenitentes.</hi> Truly this is expreſly againſt the ſeverity of the former doctrine; and if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had been the Author of this book, I ſhould have confeſs'd him to be an adverſary in this queſtion. For this Author affirms, that then when <hi>the ſoul is expiring, God rejects not the contrition of him who but then returns: Though the man be compelled to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, though the time be ſhort, and the iniquity was long and great, yet in the laſt hour, if he be truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite, God will not refuſe him.</hi> To this I ſay, that he that ſaid theſe words was
<note n="*" place="margin">Arnoldus Abbas.</note> 
                     <hi>one that liv'd not very long ſince;</hi> then, when Diſcipline was broken, and Piety was loſt, and Charity was waxen cold; and ſince the mans authority is nothing, I need ſay no more, but that I have been reproving this opinion all this while. But there are words in S. <hi>Cyprians</hi> book to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrianus,</hi> which are confeſſedly his, and yet ſeem to promiſe pardon to dying penitents. <hi>Nec quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam aut peccatis retardetur aut annis, quo minus ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niat ad conſequendam ſalutem.

Venia confitenti datur, &amp; credenti in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgentia ſalutaris de Divinâ pietate conceditur, &amp; ad immortalitatem ſub ipſâ morte tranſitur.</hi> Theſe words are indeed very expreſly affirmative of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of a very late, even of a death-bed repentance, if it ſhould ſo happen. But the conſideration of the perſon wholly alters the caſe, and makes it unappli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to the caſe of dying Chriſtians. For <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trianus</hi> was then a Pagan, and a cruel perſecutor of Chriſtians. <hi>Nec ſaltem contentus es dolorum noſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum compendio, &amp; ſimplici ac veloci brevitate poena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum: admoves laniandis corporibus longa tormenta. Innoxios, juſtos, Deo charos domo privas, patrimonio ſpolias, catenis premis, carcere includis, beſtiis, gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio, ignibus punis.</hi> This man S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> according to the Chriſtian Charity which teaches to pray for our perſecutors, and to love our enemies, exhorts paſſionately to believe in Chriſt, to become a Chriſtian, and though he was very old, yet to repent even then would not be too late. <hi>Hujus Sacramento &amp; ſigno cenſeamur; Hunc (ſi fieri poteſt) ſequamur omnes.</hi> Let us all follow Chriſt; let us all be conſign'd with his ſign and his Sacrament. Now there is no peradventure but new converted perſons, Heathens newly giving up their Names to Chriſt and being baptized, if they die in an hour, and were baptized half an hour after they believe in Chriſt, are heirs of ſalvation. And it was impoſſible to be otherwiſe; for when the Heathen world was to be converted, and the Goſpel preached to all perſons, old men, and dying men, it muſt either be effective to them alſo of all the promiſes, or by nothing could they be called to the Religion. They who were not Chriſtians, were not to be judged by the Laws of Chriſt. But yet Chriſtians are; and that's a full account of this particular, ſince the Laws of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:115796:171"/>require of us a holy life; but the Religion could demand of ſtrangers nothing but to believe, and at firſt to promiſe to obey, and then to do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly if they ſhall live. Now to do this, was never too late; and this is all which is affirmed by S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi>

                  <p>But S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks words which are not eaſie to be reconciled to the former doctrine. The words of S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> are theſe: <q>
                        <hi>Take heed of ſaying,
<note place="margin">Ad Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorum lupſum.</note> that there is a place of pardon onely for them that
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:115796:172"/>have ſinn'd but little. For if you pleaſe ſuppoſe any one abounding with all maliciouſneſs, and that hath done all things which ſhut men from the Kingdome; let this man be (not a Heathen, but) a Chriſtian and accepted of God, but afterwards an Whoremonger, an Adulterer, an effeminate perſon, unnaturally luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, a thief, a drunkard, a ſlanderer, and one that hath diligently committed ſuch crimes, truly I will not be to him an author of deſpairing, although, he had perſevered in theſe wickedneſſes to an extreme old age.</hi>
                     </q> Truly neither would I. But neither could he nor any man elſe be forward to warrant his particular. But if the remaining portion of his old age be well imployed, according as the time is, and the ſpending of that time, and the earneſtneſs of the repentance, and the greatneſs of the grief, and the heartineſs of the return, and the fulneſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the zeal of amends, and the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of charity, and the largeneſs of the devotion, ſo we approach to very many degrees of hope. But there is difference between the caſe of an extreme old age, and a death-bed. That may have more time, and better faculties, and fitted opportunities, and a clearer choice, and a more perfect reſiſtance between temptation and grace. But for the ſtate of death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, although there is in that alſo ſome variety, yet the beſt is very bad, and the worſt is ſtark naught; but concerning the event of both, God onely is the Judge. Onely it is of great uſe that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſays in the ſame Letters to <hi>Theodorus, Quódque eſt majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris facilitatis argumentum, etiamſi non omnem prae ſe fert poenitentiam, brevem illam &amp; exiguo tempore factam non abnuit, ſed magnâ mercede compenſat.</hi> Even a dying perſon ought not to deſpair, and leave off to do thoſe little things of which onely there is then left to him a poſſibility; becauſe even that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Repentance, done in that little time, God rejects
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:115796:172"/>not, but will give to it a great reward. So he did to <hi>Ahab.</hi> And whatſoever is good, ſhall have a good, ſome way or other it ſhall finde a recompence: but every recompence is not eternal glory, and every good thing ſhall not be recompenſed with heaven. To the ſame purpoſe is that of <hi>Coeleſtinus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Epiſt. 1.</note> reproving them that denied repentance to perſons, <hi>qui obitus ſui tempore hoc animae ſuae cupiunt remedio ſubveniri,</hi> who at the time of their death deſired to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to it. <hi>Horremus fateor tantae impietatis aliquem reperiri, ut de Dei pietate deſperet; quaſi non poſſet ad ſe quovis tempore concurrenti ſuccurrere, &amp; pericli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantem ſub onere peccatorum hominem, pondere quo ſe expedire deſiderat, liberare.</hi> I confeſs (ſaith he) we abhor that any one ſhould be found to be of ſo great impiety as to deſpair of Gods mercy; as if he could not at any time relieve him that comes to him, and eaſe him that runs to be eaſed of the burthen of his ſins. <hi>Quid hoc rogo aliud eſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>What elſe is this but to adde death to the dying man, and to kill his ſoul with cruelty, by denying that he can be abſolved, ſince God is moſt ready to help, and inviting to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, thus promiſes, ſaying, In what day ſoever the ſinner ſhall be converted, his ſins ſhall not be imputed to him; and again, I would not the death of a ſinner; but that he ſhould be converted and live? He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore takes ſalvation from a man, who denies him his hoped for repentance in the time of his death; and he deſpairs of the clemency of God, who does not believe it ſufficient to help the dying man in a moment of time. The thief on the Croſs hanging on Chriſts right hand had loſt his reward, if the repentance of one hour had not helped him. When he was in pain he repented and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd Paradiſe by one diſcourſe. Therefore the true converſion to God of dying perſons, is to be accounted of by the minde rather then by time.</hi> Thus far S. <hi>Coele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine,</hi> The ſumme of which is this; That dying
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:115796:173"/>perſons muſt not be thruſt into deſpair: Becauſe Gods mercy is infinite, and his power is infinite. He can do what he pleaſe, and he may do more then we know of, even more then he hath promiſed; and therefore they that are ſpiritual muſt not refuſe to do all that they can to ſuch miſerable perſons. And in all this there is nothing to be reproved, but that the good man by incompetent arguments goes about to prove what he had a minde to. If the hindring ſuch perſons to deſpair be all that he intends, it is well; if more be intended, his arguments will not do it.</p>

But how know you that God will not forgive him? You ſay true. How? I know not. I know that, I know not this. For therefore I give repentance to you, becauſe I know not. For if I knew it would profit you nothing, I would not give it you. And if I did know that it would profit you, I would not affright you. There are but theſe two things.

For the voyce of the penitent alone is not ſufficient for the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his faults: for in the ſatisfaction for great crimes, not words, but works are look'd after. Truly repentance is given in the laſt, becauſe it cannot be denied; but we cannot affirm, that they who ſo ask, ought to be abſolved. For how can the lapſed man doe penance? How ſhall the dying man doe it? How can he repent, who cannot doe works of ſatisfaction</hi> or amendment of life? <hi>And therefore that repentance which is required by ſick men, is it ſelf weak; that which is required by dying men, I fear leſt that alſo die.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. Old men may exerciſe many acts of chaſtity both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external. For if they may be unchaſt, they may alſo be chaſt: But S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:115796:175"/>ſin with ineffective luſts; as he that luſts after a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom he cannot have, ſins with his ſoul. Now where ever theſe unlawful deſires can be, there alſo they can be mortified; and an old man can love to talk of his paſt vanities, or not reſcind them by repentance, or deſire that he were young and active in wickedneſs; and therefore if he chooſes not to doe ſo, and therefore avoids theſe and the like, out of hatred of his old impurities, he does the proper works of that grace, which he alſo may doe the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier, becauſe then his temptations to the contrary are not ſo ſtrong: but this advantage is not worth ſtaying for ſo long. They that doe ſo, venture dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation a long time together, and may alſo have an evil proper to that ſtate, greater then this little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage I inſtance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> If there were no other act of chaſtity to be exerciſed by old perſons, by reaſon of their diſabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; yet the very accepting from the hands of God that diſability, and the delighting in that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of things, in which it is impoſſible to ſin as formerly, muſt needs be pleaſing to God, becauſe it is a nolition of the former ſins, and a deſire of pleaſing him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Every act of ſorrow for unchaſtity is an act of chaſtity; and if this ſorrow be great, and laſting, permanent and habitual, it will be productive of much good. And if to theſe the penitent addes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal actions and deteſtations of his crimes, revenge and apt expreſſions of his holy anger againſt his ſin, theſe doe produce a quality in the ſoul contrary to that which made him formerly conſent to luſt.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When a vicious habit is to be extirpated,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and the contrary introduc'd, it is not neceſſary that the contrary be acted by the body, but be radicated in the ſoul; It is neceſſary that the body doe not ſin
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:115796:176"/>in that inſtance; but it is not always required, that contrary acts be done by the body. Suppoſe <hi>Origen</hi> had been a luſtful perſon before his caſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he might have been habitually chaſt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by doing ſpiritual acts of a corporal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity. And there are many ſins whoſe ſcene lies in the body, to which the body afterwards cannot op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a bodily act in the ſame inſtance; as he that by intemperate drinking once or oftner, fals into a loathing of wine; he that diſmembers himſelf and many others; for which a repentance is poſſible and neceſſary, but yet a contrary ſpecifick act can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be oppoſed. In theſe caſes it is ſufficient that the habit be plac'd in the ſoul, and a perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary quality ſuperinduc'd, which is to be done by a frequent repetition of the acts of repentance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the ſin.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> There are ſome ſins for which amends is to be made in the way of commutation, when it cannot be in the proper inſtance. <hi>Redime peccata tua eleemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſynis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 4.27.</note> ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar, Redeem thy ſins with alms, and thy iniquities by ſhewing mercy to the poor.</hi> Our Engliſh Bibles read this, <hi>Break off thy ſins by alms;</hi> as if alms were directly contrary to pride, or luſt, or gluttony, or tyranny; and the ſhewing mercy to the poor a direct interciſion and interruption of the ſin. He that gives alms that he may keep his luſt, loſes his ſoul and his money too. But he that leaves his luſt, or is driven from it, and gives alms to obtain Gods favour for his pardon, by doing ſomething that is gracious in his eyes, this man is a good penitent; if his alms be great and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable, given freely and without conſtraint, when he can keep them, and receive and retain the temporal advantage and be aſſiſted by all thoſe other acts and habits of which his preſent ſtate is capable. It cannot be ſaid, that to give alms can
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:115796:176"/>in all ſuch caſes be ſufficient; as it will be hard to ſay that ſo many acts of the contrary grace will ſuffice to get a habit, or obtain a pardon; but it is true, that to give alms is a proper action of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in ſuch caſes, and is in order to pardon. For,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As there is a ſupreme habit of vice,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent vileneſs, that is, a cuſtome and readineſs to doe every ſin as it is preſented in its proper tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, and this is worſe then the habit of any one ſin: ſo there is a tranſcendent habit of grace, by which a man is ſo holy and juſt and good, that he is ready to obey God in every inſtance. That is <hi>malice,</hi> and this is <hi>charity.</hi> When a man hath this grace habitually, although it may be ſo that he cannot produce the proper ſpecifick habit oppoſite to his ſin for which he ſpecially repents, yet his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme habit does contain in it the ſpecifick habit virtually and tranſcendently. An act of this charity will not doe this, but the habit will. For he that does a ſingle act of charity, may alſo doe a ſingle act of malice; and he that denies this, knows not what he ſays, nor ever had experience of himſelf or any man elſe. For if he that does an act of charity, that is, he who by a good motion from Gods Spirit does any thing becauſe God hath commanded, to ſay that this man will doe every thing which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, is to ſay that a good man can never fall into a great ſin, which is evidently untrue. But if he that does one act in obedience to God, or in love to him, (for obedience is love) will alſo doe more, then every man that does one act to pleaſe his ſenſes, may as well be ſuppoſed that he will doe more; and then no mans life ſhould have in it any variety, but be all of a piece, intirely good, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely evil. I ſee no difference in the inſtances, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can there be, ſo long as a man in both ſtates
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:115796:177"/>hath a power to chooſe. But then it will follow, that a ſingle act of contrition, or of charity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put a man into the ſtate of the Divine favour, it muſt be <hi>the grace,</hi> or <hi>habit of charity;</hi> and that is a magazine of habits by equivalency, and is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally <hi>the ſtate of grace.</hi> And upon theſe accounts, if old men will repent, and doe what they can do, and are enabled in that ſtate, they have no cauſe to be afflicted with too great fears concerning the inſtances of their habits, or the ſins of their youth. Concerning perſons that are ſeis'd upon by a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring ſickneſs, I have nothing peculiar to ſay, ſave this onely. That their caſe is in ſomething better then that of old men, in ſome things worſe. It is better, becauſe they have in many periods of their ſickneſs more hopes of returning to health and long life, then old men have of returning to ſtrength and youth, and a protracted age: and therefore their repentance if it be hearty, hath in it alſo more degrees of being voluntary, and relative to a good life. But in this their caſe is worſe. An old man that is healthful is better ſeated in the ſtation of penitents, and becauſe he can chooſe contraries, is the more acceptable if he chooſes well. But the ſick man though living long in that diſadvantage, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be indifferent in ſo many inſtances as the other may: and in this caſe, it is remarkable what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Si autem vis agere poenitentiam quando jam peccare non potes, peccata te dimiſerunt, non tu illa.</hi> To abſtain from ſin when a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, is to be forſaken by ſin, not to forſake it. At the beſt it is bad enough: But I doubt not but if they doe what they can doe, there is mercy for them, which they ſhall finde in the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences.</p>
                  <p>Obj. 7.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="69"/> But how ſhall any man know whether he have perform'd his repentance as he ought? For
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:115796:177"/>if it be neceſſary that he get the habits of vertue, and extirpate the habits of vice; that is, if by habits God do, and we are to make judgements of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, who can be certain that his ſins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, and himſelf reconcil'd to God, and that he ſhall be ſav'd? The reaſons of his doubts and fears are theſe. 1. Becauſe it is a long time before a ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit can be loſt, and the contrary obtain'd. 2. Becauſe while one habit leſſens, another may undiſcernibly increaſe, and it may be a degree of covetouſneſs may expel a degree of prodigality. 3. Becauſe a habit may be lurking ſecretly, and for want of opportunity of acting in that inſtance, not betray it ſelf, or be diſcover'd, or attempted to be cur'd. For he that was not tempted in that kinde where he ſinn'd for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, may for ought he knows, ſay that he hath not ſinn'd onely becauſe he was not tempted; but if that be all, the habit may be reſident, and kill him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly. Theſe things muſt be accounted for.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> But to him that inquires whether it be light or darkneſs, in what regions his inheritance is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd, and whether his Repentance is ſufficient, I muſt give rather a reproof then an anſwer; or at leaſt ſuch an anſwer as will tell there is no need of an anſwer. For indeed it is not good inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into meaſures and little portions of grace. * <hi>Love God with all thy heart, and all thy ſtrength,</hi> do it heartily, and do it alwayes. If the thing be brought to paſs clearly and diſcernibly, the pardon is certain, and not orious: But if it be in a middle ſtate, between ebbe and floud, ſo is our pardon too, and if in that undiſcerned ſtate it be in the thing cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that thou art on the winning and prevailing ſide, if really thou doeſt belong unto God, he will take care both of thy intermediall comfort, and final intereſt. * But when people are too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitive after comfort, it is a ſigne their duty
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:115796:178"/>is imperfect. In the ſame proportion alſo it is not well when we enquire after a ſign for our ſtate of grace and holineſs. If the habit be compleat and intire, it is as diſcernible as light, and we may as well enquire for a ſign to know when we are hungry and thirſty, when you can walk, or play on the lute. The thing it ſelf is its beſt indication.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> But if men will quarrel at any truth, becauſe it ſuppoſes ſome men to be in ſuch a caſe, that they do not know certainly what will become of them in the event of things, I know not how it can be help'd; I am ſure they that complain here, that is, the Roman Doctors, are very fierce Preachers of the certainty of ſalvation, or of our knowledge of it. But be they who they will, ſince all this uncertainty proceeds not from the doctrine, but from the evil ſtate of things into which habitual ſinners have put themſelves, there will be the leſs care taken for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. But certainly it ſeems ſtrange that men who have liv'd baſely and viciouſly all their dayes, who are reſpited from an eternal Hell by the miracles of mercy, concerning whom it is a wonderful thing that they had not really periſhed long before, that theſe men returning at the laſt, ſhould complain of hard uſage, becauſe it cannot be told to them as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently as to new baptized Innocents, that they are certain of their ſalvation as S. <hi>Peter</hi> and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> * But however, both they, and better men then they, muſt be content with thoſe glorious meaſures of the Divine mercy which are deſcribed, and upon any terms be glad to be pardon'd, and to hope and fear, to mourn and to be afflicted, to be humbled and to tremble, and then to <hi>work out their ſalvation with fear and trembling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="72"/> But then (to advance one ſtep further) there may be a certainty where is no evidence; that is, the thing may be certain in it ſelf, though not known
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:115796:178"/>to the man; and there are degrees of hope concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the final event of our ſouls: For ſuppoſe it cannot be told to the habitual ſinner, that his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits of ſin are overcome, and that the Spirit rules in all the regions of his ſoul; yet is he ſure that his vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habits do prevail? is he ſure that ſin does reign in his mortal body? If he be, then let him not be angry with this doctrine; for it is as bad with him, as any doctrine can affirm. But if he be not ſure that ſin reigns, then can he not hope that the Spirit does rule? and if ſo, then alſo he may hope that his ſins are pardon'd, and that he ſhall be ſav'd. And if he look for greater certainty then that of a holy and a humble hope, he muſt ſtay till he have a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, it cannot be had from the certainty of any propoſition in Scripture applicable to his caſe and perſon.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> If a habit be long before it be maſter'd, if a part of it may conſiſt with its contrary, if a habit may lurk ſecretly and undiſcernibly, all theſe things are aggravations of the danger of an habitual ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and are very true, and great engagements of his watchfulneſs and fear, his caution and obſervance. But then nor theſe nor any thing elſe can evacuate the former truths; nor yet ought to make the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning ſinner to deſpair: Onely this; If he fears that there may be a ſecret habit unmortified, let him go about his remedy. 2. If he ſtill fears, let him put himſelf to the trial. 3. If either that does not ſatisfie him, or he wants opportunity, let him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour to encreaſe his ſupreme habit, the habit of Charity, or that univerſal grace of the love of God, which will ſecure his ſpirit againſt all ſecret undiſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nible vicious affections.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> This onely is certain: No man needs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair that is alive, and hath begun to leave his ſins, and to whom God hath given time, and power, and
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:115796:179"/>holy deſires. If all theſe be ſpent, and nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main beſides the deſires, that is another conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt receive its ſentence by the meaſures of the former doctrine. But for the preſent, a man ought not to conclude againſt his hopes, becauſe he findes propenſities and inclinations to the former courſes remaining in him, even after his converſion. For ſo it will be always, more or leſs, and this is not onely the remains of a vicious habit, but even of natural inclination in ſome inſtances.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="75"/> Then the habit hath loſt its killing quality, and the man is freed from his ſtate of ungraciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when the habit of vertue prevails, when he obeys frequently, willingly, chearfully. But if he ſins frequently, and obeys his temptations readily; if he delights in ſin, and chooſes that; that is, if his ſins be more then ſins of infirmity (as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed under their proper title) then the habit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, and the man is in the ſtate of death. But when ſentence is given for God, when vertue is the greater ingredient, when all ſin is hated, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd, and pray'd againſt, the remaining evils and ſtruglings of the Serpent are ſigns of the Spirits vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, but alſo engagements of a perſevering care and watchfulneſs, leſt they return, and prevail anew. He that is converted, and is in his contentions for heaven, is in a good ſtate of being; let him go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <hi>He that is juſtified, let him be juſtified ſtill;</hi> but whether juſt now if he dies he ſhall be ſav'd or not, we cannot anſwer, or give accounts of every period of his new life. In what minute or degree of Repentance his ſins are perfectly pardon'd, no man can tell; and it is unreaſonable to reprove a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that infers a man to be uncertain, where God hath given no certain notices or meaſures. If a man will be certain, he muſt die as ſoon as he is worthily baptiz'd, or live according to his promiſes then made.

So that every new ſin to ſuch a perſon is a double damage, it pulls him back from all his hopes, and makes his labours vain, and he is as far to ſeek, and as much to begin again as ever, and more. For ſo may you ſee one climbing of a Rock, with a great contention and labour and danger, if when he hath got from the foot to the ſhoulder, he then lets his hold go, he falls lower then where he firſt ſet his foot, and ſinks deeper by the weight of his own fall. So is the new converted man who is labouring to overcome the rocks and mountains of his habitual ſins; every ſin throws him down further, and bruiſes his very bones in the fall. To this purpoſe therefore is the wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the ſon of <hi>Sirach, Haſt thou ſinn'd? do ſo no more, but aske pardon for thy former fault: Adde not ſin to ſin, for in one a man ſhall not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed.</hi>

And therefore ſo may vertue. And complain not that Nature helps and corroborates the habits of ſin: For beſides that Nature doth this miſchief but in ſome inſtances,
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:115796:180"/>not in all; the Grace of God will as much aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the cuſtomes and labours of vertue, as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth the habits of vice. And chooſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you will. Take any inſtitution or courſe of life, let it at firſt be never ſo violent, <hi>uſe</hi> will make it pleaſant. And therefore we may make vertue as certain as vice is, as pleaſing to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as hard to be removed, as perfective of our nature as the other is deſtructive; and make it by aſſuefaction as impoſſible to be vicious, as we now think it difficult and impoſſible to overcome fleſh and bloud. * But let him remember this alſo, that it will be a ſtrange ſhame, that he can be in a ſtate of ſin and death from which it will be very hard to remove, and to confeſs our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo caitiff and baſe, that we cannot as eaſily be united unto vertue; that he can become a Devil, and cannot be like an Angel; that he can decline to the brutiſhneſs of beaſts, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ariſe up to a participation of the excellent beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the intellectual world.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> He that undertakes the repentance of his vicious habits, when he hath ſtrength and time enough for the work, muſt do it in kinde; that is, he muſt oppoſe a habit to a habit, every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its contrary: as Chaſtity to his Wanron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Temperance to his Gluttony or Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: The reaſon is, becauſe if he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the habit of a ſin, eſpecially of youthful ſins, unleſs the habit of vertue be oppos'd to the inſtance of his ſin, he cannot be ſafe, nor peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. For while the temptation and fierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations remain, it cannot be a cure to this to doe acts of Charity; he muſt doe acts of Chaſtity, or elſe he will fall or continue in his uncleanneſs; which in old perſons will not be. Here the ſin ſtill tempts by natural inclination,
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:115796:181"/>and commands by the habit; and therefore as there can be no <hi>Repentance</hi> while the affections remain, ſo neither can there be <hi>ſafety</hi> as long as the habit hath a natural being. The firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with a moral revocation of the ſin; and the ſame hath alſo its progreſſion, perfection, and ſecurity, by the extinction of the inherent qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Let the penitent ſeek to obſtruct or divert the proper principles of evil habits; for by the ſame by which they begin, commonly by the ſame they are nurſed up to their ugly bulke. There are many of them that attend upon the Prince of Darkneſs, and miniſter to the filthy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. Evil examples, Natural inclinations, falſe propoſitions, evil prejudices, indulgence to our own infirmities, and many more: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, a cohabitation with the temptation, by which we fell and did enter into death, and by which we uſe to fall. * There are ſome men more in love with the temptation then with the ſin; and becauſe this ruſhes againſt the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence rudely, and they ſee death ſtand at the end of the progreſſion, therefore they onely love to ſtand upon <hi>Mount Ebal</hi> and view it. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve they will not commit the ſin, they will not be overcome, but they would fain be tempted. If theſe men will but obſerve the contingencies of their own own ſtate, they ſhall finde that when they have ſet the houſe on fire, they cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe its meaſures of burning. * <hi>But there is a ſecret iniquity in it.</hi> For he that loves to ſtand and ſtare upon the fire that burnt him formerly, is pleas'd with the warmth and ſplendour, and <hi>the temptation it ſelf hath ſome little correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to the appetite.</hi> The man dares not fornicate, but loves to look upon the beauties of a woman,
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:115796:181"/>or ſit with her at the wine, till his heart is ready to drop aſleep. He will not enter into the houſe, becauſe it is infected with the plague, but he loves to ſtand at the door, and fain would enter if he durſt; <hi>It is impoſsible that any man ſhould love to abide by a temptation for a good end. There is ſome little ſenſuality in being tempted:</hi> And the very conſideration concerning it, ſometimes ſtrikes the fancy too unluckily, and pleaſes ſome faculty or other, as much as the man dares admit. * I doe not ſay, that to be tempted is always crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, or in the neighbourhood of it; but it is the beſt indication of our love to God, for his ſake to deny its importunity, and to overcome it: but that is onely, when it is unavoidable and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, againſt our wils, or at leaſt beſides our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. * For in the declination of ſin, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming temptation, there can be but theſe two things by which we can ſignify our love to God. 1. To ſtand in a temptation when we could not avoid it. 2. And to run from it, when we can. This hath in it more of prudence, and the other of force and ſpiritual ſtrength: and we can beſt ſignify the ſenſe of our weakneſs, and our carefulneſs by avoiding the occaſions; but then we declare the excellency of our purpoſes, and pertinacious love to God, when we ſerve him in hard battels, when we are tempted as before, but fall not now as we did then. Indeed this is the greateſt trial; and when God ſuffers us ſo to be tried, we are accepted if we ſtand in that day, and in ſuch circumſtances. But he that will chooſe that ſtate, and dwell near his danger, loves not to be ſafe; and either he is a vain perſon in the confidences of his own ſtrength, or elſe he loves that which is like a ſin, and comes as near it as he dare; and very often, the event of it is, that at laſt he dies like a flie about a candle.
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:115796:182"/>But he that hath fallen by ſuch a neighbourhood, and ſtill continues the cauſe, may as well hope to cure his feaver by full draughts of the new vintage, as return to life upon that account. * <hi>A vicious habit is maintain'd at an eaſie rate, but not cur'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a mighty labour and expence: any thing can feed it, but nothing can deſtroy it, if there be any thing near it, whereby it can be kept alive.</hi> If therefore you will cure a vicious habit dwell far from danger, and tempt not death with which you have been ſo long in love.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A vicious habit never could have come to that ſtate and period but by impunity. If God had ſmitten the ſinner graciouſly in the beginning of his evil journey, it is likely that as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, he alſo would have offered to goe back. Now when God does not puniſh a ſinner early, though it hath in it more of danger and leſs of ſafety, yet we may in ſome meaſure ſupply the want of Divine mercy ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and hindring a ſinner, by conſidering that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity is no mark of innocence, but very often it is an indication of Gods extremeſt and final anger. Therefore be ſure, ever to ſuſpect a proſperous ſin. For of it ſelf proſperity is a temptation, and it is granted but to few perſons to be proſperous and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. The poor and the deſpiſed, the humble and neceſſitous; he that daily needs God with a ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apprehenſion, that feeds upon neceſſity, and lives in hardſhips, that is never flatter'd, and is never cheated out of vertue for bread, thoſe perſons are likely to be wiſe and wary; and if they be not, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can make them ſo; for he that is impatient in want is impotent in plenty; for impatience is pride, and he that is proud when he is poor, if he were rich he would be intolerable; and therefore it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to bear poverty temperately then riches.

                  <p>It is not this or that alone that is contrary to God.

But now in thy return conſider proportionably concerning thy acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of repentance and piety, whether they be tranſient or permanent. Good men often ſay their prayers, and chooſe good forms, and offices, the beſt they can, and they uſe them with an earneſt and an actual devotion; but he that hath prayed long, and well, yet when he riſes it may be he cannot tell all the particulars which he begg'd of God. I doubt not but thoſe prayers which contain matter in them agreeable to his uſual and conſtant deſires, and are actually attended to in the time of their uſe, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded

But then it is to be obſerv'd, that thoſe tranſient acts of devotion, or other volatile and fugitive inſtances of Repentance, are not the proper and proportion'd remedy to the evil of vicious habits.

<pb n="327" facs="tcp:115796:190"/>live at all; * and therefore to place our hopes upon a death-bed repentance onely, is ſuch a religion as ſatisfies all our appetites, and contradicts none, and yet promiſes heaven at laſt. * Theſe things, I ſay, are all either notorious and evident, or expreſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in Scripture; and therefore that in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way of things, in the common expectation of events, ſuch perſons are in a very ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                     <p>So that it remains,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> that in this ſad condition there muſt be ſome extraordinary way found out, or elſe this whole enquiry is at an end. Concerning which, all that I can ſay is this. 1. God hath an Almighty power, and his mercy is as great as his power. He can doe miracles of mercy, as well as miracles of mightineſs. And this S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> brings in open pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt deſperation. <hi>O homo quicunque illam multitudinem peccatorum attendis, cur &amp; omnipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam coeleſtis medici non attendis?</hi> Thy ſins are great, but Gods mercies are greater. But this does repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the mans condition at the beſt to be ſuch, that God may if he will have mercy upon him; but whether he will or no, there is as yet no other cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty or probability, but that he can if he pleaſe: which propoſition to an amazed timorous perſon that fears a hell the next hour, is ſo dry a ſtory, ſo hopeleſs a propoſition, that all that can be ſaid of this, is, that it is very fit that no man ſhould ever put it to the venture. For upon this argument, we may as well comfort our ſelves upon him that died without repenting at all. But the inquiry muſt be further.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> All mankinde, all the Doctors of the Church for very many ages at leaſt, ſome few of the moſt Ancient, and of the Modern excepted, have been apt to give hopes to ſuch perſons, and no man bids them abſolutely deſpair. Let ſuch perſons make uſe
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:115796:191"/>of this eaſineſs of men, thereby to retain ſo much hope as to make them call upon God, and not to neglect what can then be done.
<q>Spem retine, ſpes una hominem nec morte relinquit.</q> As long as there is life there is hope, and when a man dies, let him not deſpair; for there is a life af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this, and a hope proper to that; and amidſt all the evils that the Ancients did fabulouſly report to be in <hi>Pandora</hi>'s box, they wittily plac'd Hope on the utmoſt lip of it, and extremity.

Now becauſe I have (as I ſuppoſe) ſaid enough to make men afraid to put off their repentance to their death-bed, yet in behalf of thoſe who have been unfortunately loſt in their lives, or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, or violently tempted, or unhappily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and are upon their death-beds, becauſe though nothing can be aſcertain'd to them, yet it is not to be ſuffer'd that they ſhould utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, I have thought fit to tranſcribe out of the writings of the ancient Doctors, ſuch exhortations as may both inſtruct and comfort, promote duty, and give ſome little door of hope, but not adde boldneſs in defiance of all the laws of holineſs.</p>
                     <p>In an epiſtle of <hi>Celeſtine</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtins</hi> time,

True converſion is to be accounted of by the minde, rather then by time.
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:115796:192"/>Therefore repentance is not to be denied to him, who at any time asks it. And he deſpairs of the clemency of God who thinks it not ſufficient, or that it cannot relieve the ſinner in an inſtant. Donec ſumus in hâc vitâ quantacunque nobis acciderint peccata, poſſibile eſt omnia ablui per poenitentiam,</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Auſtin.</hi>

The mercy of God cannot be hindred by time. For what is thy ſin to Gods mercy? even as a ſpiders web, when the winde blows it is gone in an inſtant. Many more there are to the ſame purpoſe, who all ſpeaking of the mightineſs of the Divine mercy, doe inſinuate their meaning to be concerning a miraculous or extraordinary mercy. And therefore I ſhall oppoſe nothing againſt this; onely ſay, that it is very ſad when men put their hopes of being ſav'd upon a miracle, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a miracle they muſt periſh. But yet then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair is entring into hell before their time, and even a courſe of the greateſt imprudence in the world, next to that they are already guilty of, that is, a putting things to that extremity. <hi>Dandum interſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium poenitentiae,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tacitus.</hi> And, <hi>Inter vitae nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; diem mortis oportere aliquid ſpatium interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere,</hi> ſaid <hi>Charls</hi> the <hi>Emperour.</hi> For, <hi>Nemo mortem venientem hilaris excepit, niſi qui ſe ad eam diu com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſuerat,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca, Repentance muſt have a ſpace

If he can, in the midſt of all theſe diſadvantages, it is well; but <hi>he cannot with chearfulneſs and joy receive his death, unleſs he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed much time and care in preparations againſt that ſad ſolemnity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now concerning theſe inſtruments of hope, I am yet to give another account, leſt this either ſeem to be an eaſineſs and flattery of ſouls, and not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable from any revelation from God; or if it be, that it is alſo a perfect deſtruction of all the former doctrine. For if it be inquired thus; Hath God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that death-bed penitents ſhall not be ſaved, or that they may be ſaved, or hath he ſaid nothing at all of it? If he hath ſaid they cannot be ſaved, why then doe I bid them hope, and ſo abuſe them with a falſe perſwaſion? If he hath ſaid that they may be ſaved, why doe I diſpute againſt it, and make them fear, where God by a juſt promiſe hath given them reaſon to be confident, and hath obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them them to believe they ſhall be ſaved? If he hath ſaid nothing of it, why are not they to be comprehended within the general rules of all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning penitents? eſpecially, ſince there was one caſe ſpecially made for their intereſt, the example of the Thief upon the Croſs? To this I ſhall give a clear and plain anſwer.</p>
                     <p>That God hath required ſuch conditions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and that the duty of repentance is of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and burden, that it cannot be finiſh'd and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by dying perſons after a vicious life, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from all the former arguments: and therefore if we make dying mens accounts upon the ſtock of Gods uſual dealing, and open revelation, their caſe is deſperate for the preceding reaſons. But why then doe I bid them hope, if their caſe be deſperate?
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:115796:193"/>Either God threatning death to all impenitent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, means not to exact death of all, but of ſome onely; or elſe when his holy Spirit deſcribes Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in ſevere characters, he ſecretly means to take leſs then he ſayes. For if it be ſuch a work that cannot poſſibly be done on a death-bed, how then can dying perſons be called upon to repent? for it is vain to repent, if it be impoſſible to hope; but if it be poſſible to do the work of Repentance on our death-bed, but onely that it is very difficult, there is in this affirmative no great matter: Every one confeſſes that, and all evil men put it to the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p>For the firſt part of the dilemma, I affirm nothing of it; God threatning death to all the impenitent, excepts none; <hi>Except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh.</hi> Neither does God exacting or deſcribing Repentance in ſevere lines, uſe any reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but with the ſame meaſures he will deal with all. For when there is a difference in the Divine mercy, it is in giving time and grace to repent, not in ſparing one and condemning another, who die equally criminal and impenitent. Thoſe little lines of hopes are not upon either of theſe foundations. For whatſoever is known or revealed, is againſt theſe perſons, and does certainly condemn them. Why then are they bidden to hope and repent? I anſwer, once for all; It is upon ſomething that we know not. And if they be not ſaved <hi>we know not how,</hi> they cannot expect to be ſaved by any thing that is revealed in their particular. When S. <hi>Peter</hi> had declared to <hi>Simon Magus</hi> that he was in the gall of bitterneſs; and yet made him <hi>pray, if peradventure the thought of his heart might be forgiven him:</hi> he did not by any thing that was revealed know that he ſhould be pardoned; but by ſomething that he did not know, there might be hope. It is at no hand
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:115796:194"/>to be diſſembled out of tenderneſs and pity to ſuch perſons, but to be affirmed openly; there is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed any thing to them that may bid them be in any degree confident. But he that hath a deadly wound, whom the Chirurgeons affirm to be hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, yet is willing to receive Cordials, and to be dreſs'd.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. If in the meaſures of life and death which are deſcribed in large characters, there be any lines ſo indefinite and comprehenſive, that they who preach and declare the doctrines, do not fully take in all that God intends, upon the account of our weakneſs and ignorance, there may be ſome little ruſhes and twigs to ſupport their ſinking hopes. For although the matters of duty, and the conditions of life and death are ſo plain and legible, that we can all underſtand our obligation, yet things are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſo deſcribed, that we can give the final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence concerning others. There is a ſecret in theſe things, which nothing ſhall open but the day of Judgement. No man may judge his brother; that is, no man can or ought to ſay, This man is damn'd; and yet we know that he that dies an impenitent Traytor, or Rebel, or Adulterer, is damn'd. But yet that adulterous <hi>Natta,</hi> or the Rebel <hi>Cinna,</hi> or the Traytor <hi>Catiline</hi> is actually damn'd, that we know not. The reaſon is, becauſe our duty is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for us to guide and walk our ſelves by, not to judge and ſentence others. And even the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, who hath authority to judge and ſentence, yet it is onely for amendment, it is univerſal, it is declarative, it is conditional; not perſonal, final, decretory, and eternal. For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe does man judge, otherwiſe does God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. There is ſome variety in the caſe, and in the perſon, and in the degrees of Repentance. There is a period, beyond which God will not admit a man
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:115796:194"/>to pardon; but when it is we know not. There is a <hi>minimum Religionis,</hi> the leaſt meaſure of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the loweſt degree of acceptability; but what it is, we cannot tell. There is alſo a proper meaſure for every one, but no man can fathom it. And the duties and parts of Repentance conſiſt in the terms of a great diſtance and latitude; and we cannot tell when a man firſt begins to be ſafe, and when he is newly eſcaped from the regions of ſin, and when he begins his ſtate of grace. Now as God abates great meaſures of his wrath, and forgives all that is paſt if we return betimes, and live twenty years in piety and repentance; ſo he does if the man do ſo nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen year, and eighteen, and ſtill ſhortning till you come to a year, or any the leaſt time that can do the work of Repentance, and exterminate his vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous habit. Now becauſe <hi>Abraham</hi> begg'd for the pardon of <hi>Sodom,</hi> if there ſhould be found fifty righteous there, and then abated five, and then five more, and then ten more, till he came to ten alone, and it is ſuppoſed that <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt gave out, and that God would have pardon'd the City for one righteous mans ſake, if <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſtill perſevered to ask: if any man will ſuppoſe that it may be done ſo in the abatements of time to be made to a returning ſinner; though I ſay it is a ſtrange diminution to come from years to one day, yet I will ſay nothing againſt it; but that length or ſhortneſs of time makes nothing to the mercies of God, but it makes very much to the duty of man, becauſe every action requires ſome time, and every habit much more: Now we have reaſon to ſay that the condition of a dying penitent after a whole wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life, is deſperate, becauſe ſo far as we underſtand things, habits are not to be extinguiſh'd, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries acquir'd but with long time and ſtudy. But if there be any ſecret way by which the Spirit of
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:115796:195"/>God does work faſter, and produce undiſcerned mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, we ought to adore that goodneſs by which it is ſo; and they that can believe this, may hope the other: In the mean time, neither the one nor the other is revealed; and ſo it ſtands as it did in the whole Queſtion.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. We finde in the inſtance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, that againſt hope he believed in hope; that is, that he had great arguments on both ſides, and therefore that in defiance of one, he would hope in the other, becauſe this could not fail him, but the other could. If it can be brought to paſs that a dying man can hope after a wicked life, it is a hope againſt hope; and of this all that I can ſay is, that it is no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the thing, to affirm that a dying penitent who hath contracted vicious habits, hath not time left him to perform that repentance which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of habitual ſinners under the pains of eternal death; and yet to bid ſuch a perſon do what he can do, and pray, if peradventure God will be intreated. Becauſe that little <hi>hopes</hi> which he is bid to have <hi>are not warranted,</hi> or relying upon pretence of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular revelation, contrary to the ſo many expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſevere duty and ſtricter conditions; but are plac'd upon the foundation of the Divine Power, and ſuch little proportions and ſimilitudes of things, and gueſſes and conjectures of kinde perſons, as can onely be ſufficient to make the dying man try what can be done.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The firſt ages of the Church did exactly uſe this method of Doctrine and Diſcipline. In ſome caſes (whereof I ſhall afterwards give account) they refus'd to declare them pardon'd, to miniſter Gods pardon to dying penitents; but yet would not bid them deſpair, but refer them to the Divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which if it be reduc'd to the cauſes of things, if we believe they proceeded reaſonably, muſt mean
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:115796:195"/>this, that they knew of no reveſation concerning the pardon of ſuch perſons; but whether God would or no pardon them, they knew not, but bid them hope well. And when they did admit dying penitents to the peace of the Church, they did it <hi>de benè eſſe,</hi> that it might do as much good as it could. But they knew not what that was. <hi>Poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam dare poſſumus, ſecuritatem dare non poſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi> They are S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> words. Now if I were to ask of him an account, it would be in the ſame way of objection as I am now untying. For did God promiſe pardon to dying penitents after a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked life; or are there fearful threatnings in Scripture againſt ſuch ſinners as certainly all in their caſe are? or hath God ſaid nothing at all concerning them? If God did promiſe pardon to ſuch, then why did not the Church give ſecurity, as well as penance? If God did threaten fearfully all ſuch perſons, why do they admit ſuch to repentance whom God will not admit to pardon, but hath threatned with eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death? If he hath ſaid nothing of them, they are to be judged by the meaſures of others; and truly that will too ſadly ring their paſſing-bell. For men in health who have contracted vicious habits, cannot be pardoned ſo long as their vicious habit remains; and they know that to overcome and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie a vicious habit, is a work of time and great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and if this be the meaſure of dying peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as well as of living and healthful, they will ſink in judgement that have not time to do their duty. But then why the Church of thoſe ages, and particularly S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſhould hope and deſpair at the ſame time for them, that is, knew no ground of revelations upon which to fix any hope of pardon for them, and yet ſhould exhort them to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which without hopes of pardon is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there is no ſenſible account to be given but
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:115796:196"/>this, that for ought they knew God might do more then they knew, and more then he had promiſed; but whether he would or not, they knew not, but by that means they thought they fairly quit their hands of ſuch perſons.</p>

But after all this ſtrict ſurvey of anſwers, if we be call'd to account for being ſo kinde, it muſt be confeſs'd that things are ſpoken out of charity and pity, more then of knowledge. The caſe of theſe men is ſad and deplorable, and it is piety when things are come to that ſtate and ſaddeſt event, to ſhew mercy by ſearching all the corners of revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for comfort, that God may be as much glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, and the dying men aſſiſted as much as may be. I remember the Jews are reproved by ſome for repealing <hi>the laſt verſe but one</hi> in the book of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and ſetting it after the laſt of all. That being a verſe of mercy, this of ſorrow and threatning; as if they would be more merciful then God himſelf, and thought it unfit to end ſo excellent a book with ſo ſad a curſing. Indeed Gods wayes are beſt, and his meaſures the ſureſt; and therefore it is not good to promiſe where God hath not promiſed, and to be kinde where he is angry, and to be free of his pardon, where he hath ſhut up and ſeal'd his trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. But if they that ſay God hath threatned all ſuch ſinners as dying penitents after wicked life are, and yet that they muſt not deſpair, are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved as too kinde; then they much more, who confidently promiſe heaven at laſt. It is indeed a compliance with humane miſery, that makes it fit to ſpeak what hopeful things we can; but if theſe hopes can eaſily be reproved, I am ſure the former ſeverity cannot ſo eaſily be confuted. That may, this cannot.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> But now things being put into this conſtitution; the inquiry into what manner of
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:115796:196"/>Repentance the dying penitent is oblig'd to, will be of no great difficulty. <hi>Qui dicit omnia nihil excipit.</hi> He that is tied to all can be excus'd from none. All that he can do is too little, if God ſhall deal with him according to the conditions of the Goſpel which are deſcrib'd, and therefore he muſt not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into meaſures, but do all, abſolutely all that he can in that ſad period. Particularly</p>

                     <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> Let him make a general confeſſion of the ſins of his whole life, with all the circumſtances of ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation; let him be mightily humbled, and huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſhamed, and much in the accuſation of himſelf, and bitterly lament his folly and miſery; let him glorifie God and juſtifie him, confeſſing that if he periſhes it is but juſt; if he does not, it is a glorious, an infinite mercy; a mercy not yet revealed, a mercy to be look'd for in the day of wonders, the day of Judgement. Let him accept his ſickneſs and his death humbly at the hands of God, and meekly pray that God would accept that for puniſhment, and ſo conſign his pardon for the reſt through the bloud of Jeſus. Let him cry mightily unto God, inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly begging for pardon, and then hope as much as he can, even ſo much as may exalt the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Divine mercy; but not too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently, leſt he preſume above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten.</p>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:115796:197"/>
                     <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Let the dying penitent make what amends he can poſſibly in the matter of real injuries and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtices that he is guilty of, though it be to the ruine of his eſtate; and that will go a great way in deprecation. Let him ask forgiveneſs, and offer forgiveneſs, make peace, tranſmit charity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and piety to his relatives.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> Next to theſe it were very fitting that the dying penitent did uſe all the means he can to raiſe up his ſpirit, and do internal actions of Religion with great fervour and excellency. To love God high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be ready to ſuffer whatſoever can come, to pour out his complaints with great paſſion and great humility; adding to theſe and the like, great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of charity, holy and prudent undertakings of ſeverity and Religion in caſe he ſhall recover: and if he can, let him do ſome great thing, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that does in one little body of action ſignifie great affections; any heroical act, any tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a holy zeal in his caſe does help to abbre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate the work of many years. If theſe things be thus done, it is all that can be done at that time, and as well as it can be then done; what the event of it will be, God onely knows, and we all ſhall know at the day of Judgement.

A certainty of dying, together with the proper effects and affections of mortality, was inflicted on him, and he was reduced to the condition of his own nature, and then begat ſons and daughters in his own likeneſs, that is, in the proper temper and conſtitution of mortal men.

<pb n="362" facs="tcp:115796:208"/>him or us any of our natural perfections, but his graces onely.</p>
                  <p>Man being left in this ſtate of pure Naturals,

                  <p>What gifts and graces,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> or ſupernatural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of Innocence, we know not, God hath no where told us; and of things unrevealed we commonly make wild conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures.

                  <p>But concerning the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi>

                     <pb n="366" facs="tcp:115796:210"/>but it had a limited effect, and reach'd onely to thoſe who were in the interval between <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes.</hi> This death was brought upon them by <hi>Adam;</hi> that is, death which was threatned to <hi>Adam</hi> onely, went forth upon them alſo who indeed were ſinners, but <hi>not after the ſimilitude of Adams tranſgreſſion;</hi> that is, who ſinn'd not ſo capitally as he did. For to ſin like <hi>Adam,</hi> is uſed as a Tragical and a high expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<note place="margin">Hoſ. 6.7.</note> So it is in the Prophet <hi>[They like men have tranſgreſſed]</hi> ſo we reade it; but in the Hebrew it is <hi>[They like Adam have tranſgreſſed]</hi> and yet death paſs'd upon them that did not ſin after the ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of <hi>Adam;</hi> for <hi>Abel,</hi> and <hi>Seth,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Patriarchs died (<hi>Enoch</hi> onely excepted;) and therefore it was no wonder that upon the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> death entred upon the world, who generally ſinn'd like <hi>Adam,</hi> ſince it paſſed on and reigned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on leſs ſinners. * It reigned upon them whoſe ſins therefore would not be ſo imputed as <hi>Adams</hi> was, becauſe there was no law with an expreſs threatning given to them as was to <hi>Adam;</hi> but although it was not wholly imputed upon their own account, yet it was imputed upon theirs and <hi>Adams.</hi> For God was ſo exaſperated with Mankinde, that <hi>being angry</hi> he would ſtill continue that puniſhment even to the leſſer ſins and ſinners, which he onely had firſt threatned to <hi>Adam:</hi> and <hi>ſo Adam brought it upon them.</hi> They indeed in rigour did themſelves deſerve it, but if it had not been for that provocation by <hi>Adam,</hi> they who ſinn'd not ſo bad, and had not been ſo ſeverely and expreſly threatned, had not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd ſo ſeverely. * The caſe is this. <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>Michal</hi> were <hi>Sauls</hi> children; it came to paſs that ſeven of <hi>Sauls</hi> iſſue were to be hanged, all equally innocent, equally culpable. <hi>David</hi> took the five ſons of <hi>Michal,</hi> for ſhe had left him unhandſomely. <hi>Jonathan</hi> was his friend, and therefore he ſpar'd his
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:115796:210"/>ſon <hi>Mephiboſheth.</hi> Here it was indifferent as to the guilt of the perſons, whether <hi>David</hi> ſhould take the ſons of <hi>Michal,</hi> or of <hi>Jonathan;</hi> but it is likely that as upon the kindeneſs which <hi>David</hi> had to <hi>Jonathan</hi> he ſpar'd his ſon, ſo upon the juſt provocation of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal</hi> he made that evil to fall upon them, of which they were otherwiſe capable, which it may be they ſhould not have ſuffered, if their Mother had been kinde. <hi>Adam was to God, as Michal to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there was in it a further deſign:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> for by this diſpenſation of death, <hi>Adam</hi> was made a figure of Chriſt: So the Apoſtle expreſly affirms; <hi>[who is the figure of him that was to come]</hi> that as death paſs'd upon the poſterity of <hi>Adam,</hi> though they ſinn'd leſs then <hi>Adam;</hi> ſo life ſhould be given to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of Chriſt, though they were imperfectly righteous, that is, not after the ſimilitude of Chriſts perfection.</p>
                  <p>But for the further clearing the Article depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the right underſtanding of theſe words,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> theſe two things are obſervable. 1. That the evil of death deſcending upon <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, for his ſake went no further then till <hi>Moſes.</hi> For after the giving of <hi>Moſes</hi> law, death paſſed no further upon the account of <hi>Adams</hi> tranſgreſſion, but <hi>by the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Moſes law,</hi> where death was anew, diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and expreſly threatned as it was to <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo went forward upon a new ſcore, but introduc'd firſt by <hi>Adam;</hi> that is, he was the cauſe at firſt, and till <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo, he was in ſome ſenſe the author, and for ever after, the precedent; and therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaid well, <hi>In Adam we all die:</hi> his ſin brought in the ſentence, <hi>in him it began,</hi> and from him it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon all the world, though by ſeveral diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 2. In the diſcourſe of the Apoſtle, thoſe that were nam'd were not conſider'd ſimply as <hi>born from
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:115796:211"/>Adam,</hi> and therefore it did not come upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Original corruption,</hi> but they were conſider'd as <hi>Sinners;</hi> juſt as they who have life by Chriſt are not conſider'd as meerly <hi>children</hi> by <hi>title,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual birth,</hi> and adoption, but as <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>faithful.</hi> But then this is the proportion and purpoſe of the Apoſtle; as God gives to theſe life by Chriſt, which is a greater thing then their imperfect righteouſneſs without Chriſt could have expected: ſo here alſo; this part of <hi>Adams</hi> poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was puniſh'd with death for their own ſin: but this death was brought upon them by <hi>Adam;</hi> that is, the rather for his provocation of God by his great tranſgreſſion.</p>
                  <p>There is now remaining no difficulty but in the words of the 19 verſe <hi>[By one mans diſobedience ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny were made ſinners.]</hi>

But that which I here dwell and relie upon is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sin</hi> is often in Scripture us'd for the puniſhment of ſin;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> and they that ſuffer, are called <hi>ſinners,</hi> though they be innocent. So it is in this caſe. <hi>By Adams diſobedience many were made ſinners;</hi> that is, the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> paſs'd upon them, and ſate upon their heads with evil effect, like that of <hi>Bathſheba; I and my ſon ſhall be accounted ſinners;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 1.21.</note> that is, evil will befall us, we ſhall be uſed like ſinners, like Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:115796:211"/>and Uſurpers. So, <hi>This ſhall be the ſin of Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zech. 14.19.</note> ſaid the Prophet: <hi>This ſhall be the puniſhment;</hi> ſo we reade it. And <hi>Cain,</hi> complaining of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his puniſhment, ſaid, <hi>Mine iniquity is greater then I can bear.</hi> * And to put it paſt all doubt, not onely <hi>puniſhment</hi> is called <hi>ſin</hi> in Scripture, but even he that bears it. <hi>Him that knew no ſin,
<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> God hath made ſin, that we might be the righteouſneſs of God in him:</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>Poſuit peccatum animam ſuam;
<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note> He hath made his ſoul a ſin,</hi> that is,
<note place="margin">Heb. 9.28.</note> obnoxious to the puniſhment of ſin. Thus it is ſaid, that <hi>Chriſt ſhall appear the ſecond time without ſin,</hi> that is, without the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſin unto ſalvation: for of ſin formally or materially, he was at firſt as innocent as at the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time; that is, pure in both. And if Chriſt who bare our burthen, became ſin for us in the midſt of his pureſt innocence, that we alſo are by <hi>Adam</hi> made ſinners, that is, ſuffer evil by occaſion of his demerit, infers not that we have any formal guilt, or enmity againſt God upon that account. <hi>Facti peccatores</hi> in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> by <hi>Adam</hi> we are made ſinners, anſwers both in the ſtory and in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to <hi>Chriſtus factus peccatum pro nobis;</hi> Chriſt was made ſin for us, that is, was expos'd to the evil that is conſequent to ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> to its puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>For the further explication of which,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable that the word [ſinner] and [ſin] in Scripture is us'd for any perſon that hath a fault or a legal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity, a debt, a vitioſity, defect, or imperfection. For the Hebrews uſe the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for any obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation which is contracted by the Law without our fault. Thus a Nazarite who had touch'd a dead body, was tied to offer a ſacrifice <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> for ſin; and the reaſon is added, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, he had ſinn'd concerning the dead body, and yet it
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:115796:212"/>was nothing but a legal impurity, nothing moral. And the offering that was made by the leprous, or the menſtruous, or the diſeaſed <hi>inprofluvio ſeminis,</hi> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, an offering for ſin, and yet it might be innocent all the way.</p>
                  <p>Thus in the Epiſtle to the Hebrews it is ſaid,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> that our bleſſed Lord (who is compared to the High-Prieſt among the Jews) did <hi>offer firſt for his own ſins;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 7.27.</note> by which word it is certain that no ſin pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly could be meant, for Chriſt was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he knew no ſin;</hi> but it means, the ſtate of his infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, the condition of his mortal body, which he took for us and our ſins, and is a ſtate of miſery and of diſtance from heaven; <hi>for fleſh and bloud cannot inherit the Kingdome of Heaven;</hi> whither Chriſt was not to go, till by offering himſelf he had unclothed himſelf of that imperfect veſture, as they that were legally impure might not go to the Temple before their offering:
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.10.</note> and therefore when by death he quit himſelf of this condition, it is ſaid <hi>[he died unto ſin.]</hi> Parallel to this is that of S. <hi>Paul</hi> in the fifth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> where the ſtate of infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is expreſly called ſin.
<note place="margin">Ver. 2.3.</note> The High-Prieſt] <hi>is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf alſo compaſſed with infirmity; and by reaſon here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he ought, as for the people, ſo alſo for himſelf to offer for ſins.</hi> This is alſo more expreſly by S.

                     </gap>, the likeneſs of the ſin of the fleſh; and thus Concupiſcence or the firſt motions and inclinations to ſin, is called ſin, and ſaid to have the nature of ſin, that is, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the likeneſs, it may be, the material part of ſin, or ſomething by which ſin is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known. And thus <hi>Origen</hi> obſerves, that an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to be offered, even for new born children, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if they were not clean from ſin. But this being an unuſual expreſſion among the Hebrews, bears its ſenſe upon the palm
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:115796:212"/>of the hand, and ſignifies onely the legal impurity in which the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, the new born babes and their Mothers were involv'd. Even Chriſt himſelf who had no Original ſin was ſubject to this purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. So we reade in S. <hi>Luke;</hi>

                  <p>Having now explicated thoſe words of S.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> 
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> which by being miſunderſtood have cauſed ſtrange devices in this Article, we may now without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice examine what really was the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and what evil deſcended upon his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Adams</hi> ſin was puniſh'd by an expulſion out of Paradiſe,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> in which was a Tree appointed to be the cure of diſeaſes and a conſervatory of life. There was no more told as done but this, and its proper conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents. He came into a land leſs bleſſed, a land which bore thiſtles and briars eaſily, and fruits with difficulty, ſo that he was forc'd to ſweat hard for his bread; and this alſo (I cannot ſay did deſcend, but) muſt needs be the condition of his children who were left to live ſo, and in the ſame place; juſt as when young <hi>Anthony</hi> had ſeis'd upon <hi>Marcus Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi>'s land, the Son alſo loſt what he never had. And thus death came in, not by any new ſentence or change of nature: for man was created mortal; and if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he ſhould have been immortal by grace, that is, by the uſe of the Tree of life; and now being driven from the place where the Tree grew, was left in his own natural conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, that is, to be ſick and die without that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.

                     <hi>viz.</hi> to die, was to ſome a puniſhment, but to others not ſo.

But to thoſe who ſinned not at all, as Infants and Innocents, it was meerly a condition of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and no more a puniſhment, then to be a childe is. It was a puniſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin; becauſe by his ſin humane Nature became diſrob'd of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural immortality, and therefore upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count they die; but as it related to the perſons, it was not a puniſhment, not an evil afflicted for their ſin, or any guiltineſs of their own, properly ſo called.</p>
                  <pb n="373" facs="tcp:115796:213"/>
                  <p>We finde nothing elſe in Scripture expreſs'd to be the effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> and beyond this without authority we muſt not go. Other things are ſaid, but I finde no warrant for them in that ſenſe they are uſually ſuppos'd, and ſome of them in no ſenſe at all. The particulars commonly reckoned, are, that from <hi>Adam</hi> we derive an Original ignorance, a proneneſs to ſin, a natural malice, a <hi>fomes,</hi> or neſt of ſin imprinted and plac'd in our ſouls, a loſs of our wills liberty, and nothing is left but a liberty to ſin, which liberty upon the ſumme of affairs is expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be a neceſſity to ſin: and the effect of all is, we are born heirs of damnation.</p>
                  <p>Concerning Original or Natural ignorance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> it is true, we derive it from our Parents, I mean we are born with it; but I do not know that any man thinks that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinn'd that ſin, <hi>Cain</hi> ſhould have been wiſe as ſoon as his Navel had been cut. Neither can we gueſs at what degree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <hi>Adam</hi> had before his fall. Certainly, if he had had ſo great a knowledge, it is not likely he would ſo cheaply have ſold himſelf and all his hopes, out of a greedy appetite to get ſome knowledge. But concerning his poſterity; indeed it is true a childe cannot ſpeak at firſt, nor underſtand; and if (as <hi>Plato</hi> ſaid) all our knowledge is nothing but memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, it is no wonder a child is born without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But ſo it is in the wiſeſt men in the world; they alſo when they ſee or hear a thing firſt, think it ſtrange, and could not know it till they ſaw or heard it. Now this ſtate of ignorance we derive from <hi>Adam,</hi> as we do our Nature, which is a ſtate of ignorance and all manner of imperfection; but whether it was not imperfect, and apt to fall into forbidden inſtances even before his fall, we may beſt gueſs at by the event; for if he had not had a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious appetite, and an inclination to forbidden
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:115796:214"/>things, by what could he have been tempted, and how could it have come to paſs that he ſhould ſin? Indeed this Nature was made worſe by ſin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deveſted of whatſoever it had extraordinary, and was left naked, and meer, and therefore it is not onely an Original imperfection which we inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but in the ſenſe now explicated, it is alſo an Original corruption. And this is all: As natural death by his ſin became a curſe, ſo our natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection became natural corruption, and that is <hi>Original ſin. Death</hi> and <hi>imperfection we derive from Adam,</hi> but both were natural to us; but <hi>by him they became actual, and penal, and by him they became worſe,</hi> as by every evil act, every principle of evil is improv'd. And in this ſenſe, this Article is affirmed by all the Doctors of the ancient Church. <hi>We are miſerable really, ſinners in account or effect,</hi> that <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly,</hi> this <hi>improperly;</hi> and are faln into ſo ſad a ſtate of things which we alſo every day make worſe, that we did need a Saviour to redeem us from it. For in Original ſin we are to conſider the principle, and the effects. The principle is the actual ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> This being to certain purpoſes by Gods abſolute dominion imputed to us, hath brought upon us a neceſſity of dying and all the affections of mortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; which although they were natural, yet would by grace have been hindred. Another evil there is upon us, and that is Concupiſcence; this alſo is natural, but it was actual before the fall, it was in <hi>Adam,</hi> and tempted him. This alſo from him is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us, and is by many cauſes made worſe, by him and by our ſelves. And this is the whole ſtate of Original ſin, ſo far as is fairly warrantable. But for the other particulars the caſe is wholly differing.</p>
                  <p>The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> neither made us

This I ſhall the leſs need to inſiſt upon, becauſe of it ſelf it ſeems ſo horrid to impute to the goodneſs and juſtice of God to be author of ſo great a calamity to Innocents, that S. <hi>Auſtins</hi> followers have generally left him in that point, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to this leſſer proportion, that Original ſin damns onely to the eternal loſs of the ſight of Gods glorious face. But to this, I ſay theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> That there are many Divine which beleeve this alone to be the worm that never dies, and the fire that never goeth out; that is, in effect, this, and the anguiſh for this is all the hell of the damned. And unleſs infants remain infants in the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on too (which no man that I know affirms) or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they be ſenſleſs and inapprehenſive, it is not to be imagined, but that all that know they are by way of puniſhment depriv'd of the glorious face of God, muſt needs have a horrible anguiſh of ſoul to eternal ages. And this argument, beſides the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of the thing,
<note place="margin">Lib. 6. in Julian. c. 4.</note> hath warrant from the words of S. <hi>Auſtin. Si hoc eis non erit malum, non ergo amabunt regnum Dei tot innocentes imagines Dei? Si autem amabunt, &amp; tantum amabunt, quantum inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centes amare debent, regnum ejus à quo ad ipſius ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginem creantur, nihílne mali de hâc ipſâ ſeparatione patientur?</hi> Here the good man and eloquent, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the little babies to be innocent, to be images of God, to love the Kingdome of God, and yet to be ſentenc'd to hell: which (it may be) he did, but I do not underſtand; ſave onely that in the Parable we finde <hi>Dives</hi> in hell to be very charitable to his living brethren. But that which I make uſe of for the preſent, is, that infants beſides the loſs of Gods preſence, and the beholding his face, are apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and afflicted with that evil ſtate of things, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their infelicity, not their fault, hath carried him.</p>
                  <pb n="376" facs="tcp:115796:215"/>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> But ſuppoſe this to be but a meer privative ſtate, yet it cannot be inflicted upon infants as a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, and upon the ſame account it cannot be inflicted upon any one elſe. Not upon infants, becauſe they are not capable of a law for themſelves, therefore much leſs of a law which was given to another, here being a double incapacity of obedience. They cannot receive any law, and if they could, yet of this they never were offer'd any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice till it was too late. Now if infants be not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of this, nor chargeable with it, then no man is; for all are infants firſt, and if it comes not by birth, and at firſt, it cannot come at all. So that although this privative hell be leſs then to ſay they are tormented in flames beſides, yet it is as unequal and unjuſt. There is not indeed the ſame cruelty, but there is the ſame injuſtice. I deny not but all perſons naturally are ſo that they cannot arrive at heaven, but unleſs ſome other principle be put into them, or ſome great grace done for them, muſt for ever ſtand ſeparate from ſeeing the face of God. But this is but accidentally occaſion'd by the ſin of <hi>Adam.</hi> That left us in our natural ſtate, and that ſtate can never come to heaven in its own ſtrength. But this condition of all men by nature is not the puniſhment of our ſin; for this would ſuppoſe, that were it not for this ſin ſuperinduc'd, otherwiſe we ſhould goe to heaven. Now this is not true; for if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, yet without ſomething ſupernatural, <hi>ſome grace and gift,</hi> we could never go to heaven. Now although the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> left him in his nakedneſs, and a meer natural man; yet preſently this was ſupplied, and we were never in it, but were improv'd and better'd by the promiſe, and Chriſt hath died for mankinde, and in ſo doing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our Redeemer and Repreſentative; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> cannot call us back from that
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:115796:215"/>ſtate of good things, into which we are put by the mercies of God in our Lord Jeſus; and therefore now no infant or idiot, or man or woman ſhall for this alone be condemn'd to an eternal baniſhment from the ſweeteſt preſence of God. But this will be evinced more certainly in the following periods. For if they ſtand for ever baniſhed from the preſence of God, then they ſhall be for ever ſhut up in hell, with the devil and his angels; for the Scripture hath men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned no portions but of the right and left hand. <hi>Greg.

But if God took off all that was due, how could God exact it of others, it being wholly pardon'd? But if God did not pardon him the eternal guilt, but took the forfeiture and made him pay the full price of his ſin, that is, all which he did threaten and intend, then it is not to be ſuppoſed that God ſhould in juſtice demand more then eternal pains as the price to be paid by one man for one ſin.

For if he did make any ſuch agreement with <hi>Adam,</hi> he beforehand knew that <hi>Adam</hi> would forfeit all, and therefore that unavoidably all his poſterity ſhould be ſurpris'd.

<note place="margin">Qui vult aliquid in cauſâ vult effectum ex iſtá cauſâ profluen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.</note> can do it without any reaſon; eſpecially when the reaſon it ſelf makes the miſery as fatal as a decree without a reaſon: And if God cannot be ſuppoſed to damn infants without juſt cauſe, and therefore he ſo order'd it that a cauſe ſhould not be wanting, but he infallibly and irreſiſtibly made them guilty of <hi>Adms</hi> ſin; is not this to reſolve to make them miſerable, and then with ſcorn to triumph in their ſad condition? For if they could not deſerve to periſh without a fault of their own, how could they deſerve to have ſuch a fault put upon them?

                  <p n="11">11. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> It is ſuppos'd and generally taught, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall <hi>Adam</hi> had Original righteouſneſs, that is, not onely that he was innocent as children new born are of actual ſin (which ſeems to be that which Divines call <hi>Original righteouſneſs,</hi> there being no other either taught, or reaſonable) but a rare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude of the inner man, a juſt ſubordination of the inferior faculties to the ſuperior, an excellent knowledge and clear light: and therefore that he would ſin had ſo little excuſe, that well it might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſuch a puniſhment, ſo great as himſelf ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. Indeed if he had no ſuch rare perfections
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:115796:217"/>and rectitude, I can ſay nothing to the particular: but to the Queſtion, this; that if <hi>Adam</hi> had it not, then he could not loſe it, nor his poſterity after him; as it is fiercely and mightily pretended that they did. But if he had this rectitude and rare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, what equity is it that his poſterity who had no ſuch helps to reſiſt the ſin, and were ſo farre from having any helps at all to reſiſt it, that they had no notice of it, neither of the law, nor the danger, nor the temptation, nor the action, till it was paſt; I ſay, what equity is it that his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity ſhould in the midſt of all theſe imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions be equally puniſhed with him, who ſinned againſt ſo great a light, and ſo mighty helps?</p>
                  <p n="12">12. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Infants cannot juſtly periſh for <hi>Adams</hi> ſin, unleſs it be juſt that their wills ſhould be included in his will, and his will juſtly become theirs by interpretation. Now if ſo, I ask, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before that ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> were our wills free, or not free? For if we had any will at all, it muſt be free, or not free. If we had none at all, how could it be involv'd in his? Now if our wills were free, why are they without our act, and whether we will or no, involv'd in the will of another? If they were not free, how could we be guilty? * If they were free, then they could alſo diſſent. If they were not free, then they could not conſent; and ſo either they never had, or elſe before <hi>Adams</hi> fall they loſt their liberty.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="35"/> But if it be inquired ſeriouſly, I cannot imagine what can be anſwered. Could we prevent the ſin of <hi>Adam?</hi> could we hinder it? were we ever ask'd? Could we, if we had been ask'd after we were born a moneth, have given our negative? Or could we do more before we were born then after? were we, or could we be tied to prevent that ſin? Did not God know that we could not in that caſe diſſent?
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:115796:218"/>And why then ſhall our conſent be taken in by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, when our diſſent could not be really acted; But if at that time we could not diſſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, could we have diſſented from <hi>Adams</hi> ſin by interpretation? If not, then we could diſſent no way, and then it was inevitably decreed that we ſhould be ruin'd: for neither really, nor by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation could we have diſſented. But if we could by interpretation have diſſented, it were certainly more agreeable to Gods goodneſſe, to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted for us in the better ſenſe, rather then in the worſe; being we did <hi>neither,</hi> really and actually; and if God had ſo pleaſed, he rather might with his goodneſſe have interpreted us to have diſſented; then he could with juſtice have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted us to have conſented: and therefore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he did ſo, or would have done, if there had been need.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> Laſtly; the Conſequent of theſe is this. That becauſe God is true and juſt and wiſe, and good, and mercifull, it is not to be ſuppoſed that he will ſnatch Infants from their Mothers breaſts, and throw them into the everlaſting flames of Hell for the ſin of <hi>Adam,</hi> that is, as to them, for their meer natural ſtate of which himſelf was Author and Creator: that is, he will not damne them for being good.

It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be contraray to God becauſe it is his work.</p>
                  <p>Upon the account of theſe reaſons I ſuppoſe it ſafe to affirme,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="37"/> that God does not damne any one to Hell meerly for the ſin of our firſt Father, which I ſumme up in the words of S. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> or whoever is the Author of the Commentaries upon the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> attributed to him;
<note place="margin">In cap. 5. Rom.</note> 
                     <hi>Mors autem diſſolutio

There is alſo another death which is in Hell, and is called the ſecond Death, which we do not ſuffer for the ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> but by occaſion of it, we fall into it by our own ſins.</p>
                  <p>Next we are to inquire, whether or no it does not make us infallibly, naturally, and neceſſarily viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, by taking from us Original righteouſneſs, by diſcompoſing the order of our faculties, and inſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the will to ſin and folly, concerning which the inquiry muſt be made by parts.</p>
                  <p>For if the ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> did debauch our Nature,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> and corrupt our will and manners, it is either by a Phyſicall or Natural efficiency of the ſin it ſelf: or 2. Becauſe we were all in the loyns of <hi>Adam,</hi> or 3. By the ſentence and decree of God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> Not by any Natural efficiency of the ſin it ſelf: Becauſe then it muſt be that every ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt ſpoile ſuch a portion of his Nature, that before he died, he muſt be a very beaſt. 2. We alſo by degeneration and multiplication of new ſins muſt have been at ſo vaſt a diſtance from him at the very worſt, that by this time we ſhould not have been ſo wiſe as a flie, nor ſo free and unconſtrain'd as fire. 3. If one ſin would naturally and by phyſical cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity deſtroy <hi>Original righteouſneſs,</hi> then every one ſin in the regenerate can as well deſtroy <hi>Habitual righteouſneſs,</hi> becauſe that and this differ not but in their principle, not in their nature and conſtitution. And why ſhould not a righteous man as eaſily and as quickly fall from grace, and loſe his habits, as <hi>Adam</hi> did? Naturally it is all one. 4. If that one ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> did deſtroy all his righteouſneſs and ours too, then our Original ſin does more hurt, and
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:115796:219"/>is more puniſh'd, and is of greater malice then our actual ſin. For one act of ſin does but leſſen and weaken the habit, but does not quite deſtroy it. If therefore this act of <hi>Adam</hi> (in which certainly, at leaſt we did not offend maliciouſly) deſtroys all Original righteouſneſs, and a malicious act now does not deſtroy a righteous habit, it is better for us in our own malice, then in our ignorance, and we ſuffer leſs for doing evil that we know of, then for doing that which we knew nothing of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> If it be ſaid, that this evil came upon us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we all were in the loins of <hi>Adam:</hi> I conſider, 1.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> That then by the ſame reaſon we are guilty of all the ſins which he ever committed while we were in his loins; there being no imaginable reaſon why the firſt ſin ſhould be propagated, and not the reſt; and he might have ſinned the ſecond time, and have ſinn'd worſe. Adde to this, that the later ſins are commonly the worſe, as being committed not onely againſt the ſame law, but a greater reaſon, and a longer experience, and heightned by the mark of ingratitude, and deeply noted with folly, for ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing damnation ſo much longer: And then he that was born laſt ſhould have moſt Original ſin; and <hi>Seth</hi> ſhould in his birth and nature be worſe then <hi>Abel,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and <hi>Abel</hi> be worſe then <hi>Cain.</hi> 2. Upon this account all the ſins of all our progenitors will be imputed to us, becauſe we were in their loins when they ſinn'd them; and every luſtful father muſt have a luſtful ſon, and ſo every man, or no man will be luſtful. For if ever any man were luſtful or intemperate when, or before he begot his childe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this reckoning his childe will be ſo too, and then his grandchilde,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and ſo on for ever. 3. Sin is ſeated in the will, it is an action, and tranſient; and when it dwells or abides, it abides no where but in the will by approbation and love, to which is naturally
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:115796:219"/>conſequent a readineſs in the inferior faculties to obey and act accordingly; and therefore ſin does not infect our meer natural faculties, but the will onely, and not that in the natural capacity, but in its moral onely. 4.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> And indeed to him that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it, it will ſeem ſtrange and monſtrous, that a moral obliquity, in a ſingle inſtance, ſhould make an univerſal change in a natural ſuſcipient, and in a natural capacity. When it is in nature impoſſible that any impreſſion ſhould be made but between thoſe things that communicate in matter or capacity; and therefore if this were done at all, it muſt be by a higher principle, by Gods own act or ſanction, and then ſhould be referred to another principle, not this againſt which I am now diſputing. 5.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> No man can tranſmit a good habit, a grace, or a vertue by natural generation; as a great Scholars ſon cannot be born with learning, and the childe of a Judge cannot upon his birth day give wiſe ſentences; and <hi>Marcus</hi> the ſon of <hi>Cicero</hi> was not ſo good an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor as his father: and how can it be then that a naughty quality ſhould be more apt to be diſſemina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted then a good one; when it is not the goodneſs or the badneſs of a quality that hinders its diſſeminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but its being an acquir'd &amp; ſuperinduc'd quality that makes it cannot deſcend naturally? Adde to this, how can a bad quality, morally bad, be directly and regularly tranſmitted by an action morally good? and ſince neither God that is the Maker of all does amiſs, and the father that begets ſins not, and the childe that is begotten cannot ſin, by what conveyance can any poſitive evil be derived to the poſterity? 6. It is generally,

And how can it be, that the father who contributes nothing to her production, ſhould contribute to her pollution? that he who did not tranſmit life, ſhould tranſmit his ſin? and yet if the ſoul were traduc'd from the parents, and begotten, yet ſin could not deſcend, becauſe it is not a natural, but a ſuperinduc'd quality; and if it could, then it would follow, that we ſhould from every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious father derive a proper Original ſin, beſides the general.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. If in him we ſinned, then it were but juſt, that in him we ſhould be puniſhed: for as the ſin is, ſo ought the puniſhment to be.

For beſides that it is a great teſtimony of the Divine favour that God will ſtill imploy us, and exact more ſervices of us, and that there is no greater argument of joy to us in the world, then that we are Gods ſervants, and there can be no greater teſtimony, that God is our God; and that of this employing us in his ſervice, there can be no greater evidence, then the giving to us new laws: Beſides this, I ſay, if man could not

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But if he commits a fault which accidentally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables him; as if he eats too much, and be ſick the next day, and fall into a feaver, he may indeed, and is juſtly puniſhed for his gluttony, but he is not puniſhable for omitting that which in his preſent weakneſs he can no ways perform. The reaſon is, becauſe this diſability was involuntary, and an evil accident; of it ſelf a puniſhment of his ſin, and therefore of it ſelf not puniſhable; and this invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarineſs is ſtill the more notorious and certain, as the conſequents are the more remote. 4.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> No man can be anſwerable to God for the conſequent of his ſin, unleſs it be natural, foretold, or foreſeen; but for the ſin it ſelf he is; and as for the conſequents ſuperinduc'd by God, he muſt ſuffer them, but not anſwer for them. For theſe being in the hands of God, are not the works of mens hands; God hath effected it upon the ſinner, he is the Author of it, and by it he is directly glorified; and therefore though by it the ſinner is puniſhed, yet for it he cannot be puniſhed again. 5.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> But that I may come to the caſe of the preſent argument. This meaſure and line of juſtice is moſt evident in laws to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed after the diſability is contracted, and not fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen before; concerning which, there can be no pretence of juſtice that the breach of them ſhould be puniſhed. If a law be already impoſed, and a man by his fault loſes thoſe aſſiſtances, without which he could not keep the law, he may nevertheleſs in the rigor of juſtice be puniſhed for not keeping it, Becauſe the law was given him when he had ſtrength, and he ought to have preſerv'd it. For though he cannot be obliged to a new law to which he is not enabled, yet for his ſin he ſhall not be
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:115796:222"/>diſoblig'd from an old law to which he was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. Although God will not exceed his meaſures, or doe wrong to a ſinner, yet by his ſin he ſhall receive no favour, or immunity. But in laws to be impoſed afterwards, the caſe (I ſay) is otherwiſe. Becauſe the perſons are not capable of any ſuch law; and God knowing they cannot perform them, cannot intend they ſhould, and therefore cannot juſtly puniſh them, for not doing that, which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf did never heartily intend they ſhould doe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew they could not. The inſtances will make the matter to be confeſſed. * Suppoſe a man falling into drunkenneſs, ſhould by the Divine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment fall lame; can God afterwards exact it of him that he ſhould leap and dance in publick feſtivities, when he can neither goe nor ſtand? If ſo, ſuppoſe yet further, that by the Divine judgement he ſhould fall mad; Is the mad man capable of a new law? I ſuppoſe it will not be ſaid he is: or if it be, ſuppoſe yet further, that he be taken ſpeechleſs, and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, or die: Can God ſtill exact of him obedience to any new Commandement? If he be dead, his day is done, he can work no more, nor be oblig'd any more; and ſo it is, if he be mad, or any ways diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled; the caſe is all one. For whatſoever the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability be, the incapacity, and impoſſibility, and the excuſe is the ſame.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 6. When God (as it is ſaid) pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the firſt ſin with a conſequent diſability of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any future ſervices, if he alſo puniſhes the not doing what he afterwards impoſes, I ask, whether this later puniſhment be preciſely due to the later, or to the former ſin? If to the later, then in vain is it laid upon the former account; and yet, if it be laid upon its own, it is high injuſtice; becauſe of this law the man was not a ſubject capable when it was impoſed, the man was dead before the law was alive: and a tree is as much capable of a law, as a man is
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:115796:222"/>of an impoſſible Commandement. But if the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this later, be inflicted upon the ſinner for the firſt tranſgreſſion by which he diſabled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then in vain was the later Commandement im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. For ſince the later ſin was unavoidable, and the firſt ſin deſerv'd the whole damnation, what end could there be of impoſing this new law, by which God could not ſerve any new purpoſe, no not for the manifeſtation of his juſtice in condemning him? For if the firſt ſin deſerv'd condemnation, there was no need to introduce a new pretence, and to ſeek an occaſion to ſlay him. But if it did not, it is certain the new ſin could not make it juſt to doe what was not juſt before, becauſe by this new omiſſion there can be no new guilt contracted. But of this I ſhall give yet a further account when I ſhall diſcourſe in what ſenſe God can be ſaid to puniſh one ſin with another.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> God never imputes the fathers ſin to the ſon or relative, formally making him guilty, or being angry with the innocent eternally. It were blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy to affirm ſo fierce and violent a cruelty of the moſt merciful Saviour and Father of mankinde; and it was yet never imagined or affirm'd by any that <hi>I</hi> know of, that God did yet ever damn an innocent ſon, though the father were the vileſt perſon, and committed the greateſt evils of the world, <hi>actually, perſonally, chooſingly,</hi> and maliciouſly: and why it ſhould by ſo many, and ſo confidently be affirm'd in a leſſer inſtance, in ſo unequal a caſe, and at ſo long a diſtance, I cannot ſuſpect any reaſon. <hi>Plutarch</hi> in his book againſt <hi>Herodotus</hi> affirms, that it is not likely they would, meaning that it was unjuſt, to revenge an injury which the <hi>Samians</hi> did to the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> three hundred years before. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge it for ever, upon all generations, and with an eternal anger upon ſome perſons, even the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, cannot without trembling be ſpoken or imagined of God, who is the great lover of Souls. Whatſoever the matter be in temporal inflictions, of which in the next propoſitions I ſhall give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, yet if the Queſtion be concerning eternal damnation, it was never ſaid, never threatned by God to paſs from father to the ſon. When God puniſhes one relative for the ſin of another, he does it as fines are taken in our law, <hi>ſalvo contenemento;</hi> the principal ſtake being ſafe, it may be juſtice to ſeiſe upon all the ſmaller portions; at leaſt it is not againſt juſtice for God in ſuch caſes to uſe the power and dominion of a Lord. But this cannot be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable to be uſed in the matter of eternal intereſt; becauſe if God ſhould as a Lord uſe his power over Innocents and condemn them to Hell, he ſhould be
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:115796:229"/>Author to them of more evil then ever he convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good to them; which but to imagine, would be a horrible impiety. And therefore when our bleſſed Saviour took upon him the wrath of God due to all mankinde yet Gods anger even in that caſe, extended no further then a temporal death. Becauſe for the eternal, nothing can make recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and it can never turn to good.</p>

How is it that all men in the world are ſinners, and that in many things we offend all? For if men could chooſe and had freedome, it is not imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that all ſhould chooſe the ſame thing. As all men will not be Phyſicians, nor all deſire to be Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. But we ſee that all men are ſinners, and yet it is impoſſible that in a liberty of indifferency there ſhould be no variety. Therefore we muſt be content to ſay, that we have onely a liberty of adheſion or delight; that is, we ſo love ſin that we all chooſe it, but cannot chooſe good.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer many things.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> 1. If we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that there muſt now be a cauſe in our nature determining us to ſin by an irreſiſtible neceſſity, I deſire to know why ſuch principle ſhould be more neceſſary to us then it was to <hi>Adam?</hi> what made him to ſin when he fell? He had a perfect liberty, and no ignorance, no original ſin, no inordination of his affections, no ſuch rebellion of the inferiour faculties againſt the ſuperiour as we complain of; or at leaſt we ſay he had not, and yet he ſinned. And if his paſſions did rebel againſt his reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fall, then ſo they may in us, and yet not
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:115796:233"/>be long of that fall. It was before the fall in him, and ſo may be in us, and not the effect of it. But the truth of the thing is this, He had liberty of choice and choſe ill, and ſo doe we: and all men ſay, that this liberty of chooſing ill, is ſtill left to us. But becauſe it is left here, it appears that it was there before, and therefore is not the conſequent of Originall ſin. But it is ſaid, that as <hi>Adam</hi> choſe ill, ſo doe we; but he was free to good as well as to evil, but ſo are not we; we are free to evil, not to good; and that we are ſo, is the conſequent of original ſin. I reply, That we can chooſe good, and as naturally love good as evil, and in ſome inſtances more. A man cannot naturally hate God, if he knows any thing of him. A man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally loves his Parents. He naturally hates ſome ſort of uncleanneſs. He naturally loves and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves himſelf: and all thoſe ſins which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, are ſuch which nature hates: and <hi>the law of nature</hi> commands all the great inſtances of vertue, and marks out all the great lines of juſtice. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is a law imprinted in the very ſubſtance of our natures, and incorporated in all generations of reaſonable creatures, not to break or tranſgreſs the laws which are appointed by God. Here onely, our nature is defective; we doe not naturally know, nor yet naturally love thoſe ſupernaturall excellencies which are appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and commanded by God as the means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to a ſupernatural condition. That is, without Gods grace, and the renovation of the Spirit of God, we cannot be ſaved. Neither was <hi>Adams</hi> caſe better then ours in this particular. For that his nature could not carry him to heaven, or indeed to pleaſe God in order to it, ſeems to
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:115796:233"/>be confeſſed by them who have therefore affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med him to have had a <hi>ſupernaturall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> which is affirmed by all the Roman party. But although in ſupernatural inſtances it muſt needs be that <hi>our Nature</hi> is defective; ſo it muſt needs have been in <hi>Adam:</hi> and therefore the <hi>Lutherans</hi> (who in this particular dream not ſo probably as the other) affirming that <hi>juſtice</hi> was <hi>natural</hi> in <hi>Adam,</hi> do yet but differ in the manner of ſpeaking, and have not at all ſpoken againſt this; neither can they, unleſs they alſo affirm that to arrive at Heaven was the natural end of man. For if it be not, then neither we nor <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> could by Nature doe things above Nature; and if God did concreate Grace with <hi>Adam,</hi> that Grace was nevertheleſs Grace, for being given him as ſoon as he was made: For even the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit may be given to a Chryſome childe; and Chriſt, and S. <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> and the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> are in their ſeveral meaſures and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inſtances of it. The reſult of which is this; That the neceſſity of Grace does not ſuppoſe that our Nature is originally corrupted; for beyond <hi>Adams</hi> meer Nature, ſomething elſe was neceſſary, and ſo it is to us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/> But to the main objection; I anſwer, That it is certain there is not onely one, but many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon principles from which ſin derives it ſelf into the manners of all men. 1. The firſt great cauſe of an univerſal impiety is, that at firſt, God had made no promiſes of Heaven, he had not propounded any glorious rewards, to be as an argument to ſupport the ſuperior faculty againſt the inferior, that is, to make the will chooſe the beſt and leave the worſt, and to be as a reward for ſuffering contradiction. For if the inferior faculty be pleas'd with its object, and that chance to be forbidden, as it was in moſt
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:115796:234"/>inſtances, there had need be ſomething to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence for the ſuffering the diſpleaſure of croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing that appetite. I uſe the common manner of ſpeaking, and the diſtinction of <hi>ſuperior</hi> and <hi>infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> faculties: though indeed in nature there is no ſuch thing; and it is but the ſame faculty, divided between differing objects; of which I ſhall give an account in the Ninth Chapter §. 3. But here I take notice of it, that it may not with prejudice be taken to the diſadvantage of this whole Article For if there be no ſuch difference of faculties founded in Nature, then the rebellion of the inferior againſt the ſuperior, is no effect of <hi>Adams</hi> ſin. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to ſenſual objects being chaſtis'd by laws and prohibitions, hath made that which we call the rebellion of the inferior, that is, the adherence to ſenſual objects; which was the more certain to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, becauſe they were not at firſt enabled by great promiſes of good things to conteſt againſt ſenſual temptations. And becauſe there was no ſuch thing in that period of the world, therefore almoſt all fleſh corrupted themſelves: excepting <hi>Abel, Seth, Enos,</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> we finde not one good man from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Noah;</hi> and therefore the Apoſtle calls that world,

                     </gap>, the world of the ungodly. It was not ſo much wonder that when <hi>Adam</hi> had no promiſes made to enable him to conteſt his natural concupiſcence, he ſhould ſtrive to make his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion better by the Devils promiſes. If God had been pleaſed to have promis'd to him the glories he hath promiſed to us, it is not to be ſuppos'd he had fallen ſo eaſily. But he did not, and ſo he fell, and all the world followed his example, and moſt upon this account, till it pleas'd God after he had tried the world with temporal promiſes, and found them alſo inſufficient, to finiſh the work of his graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and to cauſe us to be born anew, by the
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:115796:234"/>revelations and promiſes of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="67"/> A ſecond cauſe of the univerſal iniquity of the world, is becauſe our Nature is ſo hard put to it in many inſtances; not becauſe Nature is origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally corrupted, but becauſe Gods laws command ſuch things which are a reſtraint to the indifferent, and otherwiſe lawful inclinations of Nature. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the matters of Temperance, Abſtinence, Patience, Humility, Self-denial, and Mortification. But more particularly thus: A man is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to deſire the company of a woman whom he fancies. This is naturally no ſin: for the natural deſire was put into us by God, and therefore could not be evil. But then God as an inſtance and trial of our obedience, put fetters upon the indefinite deſire, and determin'd us to one woman; which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was enough to ſatisfie our need, but not all our poſſibility. This therefore he left as a reſerve, that by obeying God in the ſo reaſonable reſtraint of our natural deſire, we might give him ſomething of our own. * But then it is to be conſidered, that our unwillingneſs to obey in this inſtance, or in any of the other, cannot be attributed to Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſin, or natural diſability deriv'd as a puniſhment from <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe the particular inſtances were poſtnate a long time to the fall of man; and it was for a long time lawful to do ſome things which now are unlawful. But our unwillingneſs and averſneſs came by occaſion of the law coming croſs upon our nature; not becauſe our nature is contrary to God, but becauſe God was pleas'd to ſuperinduce ſome Commandements contrary to our nature. For if God had commanded us to eat the beſt meats, and drink the richeſt wines as long as they could pleaſe us, and were to be had, I ſuppoſe it will not be thought that Original ſin would hinder us from obedience. But becauſe we are forbidden to do ſome things
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:115796:235"/>which naturally we deſire to do and love, therefore our nature is hard put to it; and this is the true ſtate of the difficulty.

                  <p>UPon this account, beſides that the cauſes of an univerſal impiety are apparent without any need of laying <hi>Adam</hi> in blame for all our follies and miſeries, or rather without charging them upon God, who ſo order'd all things as we ſee and feel; the univerſal wickedneſs of man is no argument to prove our will ſervile, and the powers of election to be quite loſt in us (excepting onely that we can chooſe evil.) For admitting this propoſition, that <hi>there can be no liberty where there is no variety;</hi> yet that all men chooſe ſin, is not any teſtimony that there is no variety in our choice. If there were but one ſin in the world, and all men did chooſe that, it were a ſhrewd ſuſpicion that they were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally determin'd or ſtrongly precipitated. But every man does not chooſe the ſame ſin, nor for the ſame cauſe; neither does he chooſe it alwayes, but frequently declines it, hates it, and repents of it: many men even among the Heathens did ſo. So that the objection hinders not, but that choice and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſtill remains to a man, and that he is not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſinful, as he is naturally heavy, or upright, apt to laugh, or weep.

                  <p>And indeed the contrary doctrine is a deſtruction of all laws,

But upon this account, it is ſo farre from being true that man after his fall did forfeit his natural power of election, that it ſeems rather to be encreaſed. For as a mans knowledge grows, ſo his will becomes bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter attended and miniſtred unto. But after his fall his knowledge was more then before; he knew what nakedneſs was, and had experience of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of things, he perceiv'd the evil and miſchief of diſobedience and the Divine anger; he knew fear and flight, new apprehenſions, and the trouble of a guilty conſcience: by all which and many other things, he grew better able, and inſtructed with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to obey God, and to refuſe ſin for the time to come. And it is every mans caſe; a repenting man is wiſer, and hath oftentimes more perfect ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin then the innocent, and is made more wary by his fall. But of this thing God himſelf is witneſs. <hi>Ecce homo tanquam ſingularis, ex ſe ipſo habet ſcire bonum &amp; malum:</hi> So the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſe reades <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. Our Bibles reade thus: <hi>And the Lord God ſaid, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil.</hi> Now as a conſequent of this knowledge, God was pleaſed by ejecting him out of Paradiſe, to prevent his eating of the Tree of Life: <hi>Ne fortè mittat manum ſuam in arborem
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:115796:237"/>vitae.</hi> Meaning, that now he was grown wiſe and apt to provide himſelf, and uſe all ſuch remedies as were before him. He knew more after his fall then before; therefore ignorance was not the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that ſin: and he that knows more, is better enabled to chooſe, and leſt he ſhould chooſe that which might prevent the ſentence of death put upon him, God caſt him from thence where the remedy did grow. Upon the authority of this place <hi>Rabbi Moſes Ben Maimon</hi> hath theſe words: <hi>Poteſt as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bera unicui<expan>

To every man is given a power that he may chooſe and be inclined to good if he pleaſe; or elſe if he pleaſe to do evil. For this is written in the Law, Behold, the man is as a ſingle one, of himſelf now he knows good and evil: as if he had ſaid, Behold, mankinde is in the world without its like, and can of his own counſel and thought know good and evil, in either of theſe doing what himſelf ſhall chooſe.

                     </gap>, ſaid <hi>Hierocles.</hi> Humane Nature is in danger to be loſt, if it diverts to that which is againſt Nature. For if it be immortal, it can never die in its nobleſt faculty.
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:115796:237"/>But if the will be deſtroyed, that is, diſabled from chooſing (which is all the work the will hath to do) then it is dead. For to live, and to be able to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, in Philoſophy is all one. If the will therefore cannot operate, how is it immortal? And we may as well ſuppoſe an underſtanding that can never un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and paſſions that can never deſire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, and a memory that can never remember, as a will that cannot chooſe. Indeed all the faculties of the ſoul that operate by way of nature can be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in individuals; but in the whole ſpecies never. But the will is not impedible, it cannot be reſtrain'd at all; if there be any acts of life; and when all the other faculties are weakeſt, the will is ſtrongeſt, and does not at all depend upon the body. Indeed it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten follows the inclination and affections of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but it can chooſe againſt them, and it can work without them. And indeed ſince ſin is the action of a free faculty, it can no more take away the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of that faculty, then vertue can; for that alſo is the action of the ſame free faculty. If ſin be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in its formality, as it is an inordination or irregularity, ſo it is contrary to vertue; but if you conſider it as an effect or action of the will, it is not at all contrary to the will, and therefore it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it ſhould be deſtructive of that faculty from whence it comes.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſay that the will is not dead,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="72"/> becauſe it can chooſe ſin, but not vertue, is an eſcape too ſlight. For beſides that it is againſt an infinite experience, it is alſo contrary to the very being and manner of a man, and his whole Oeconomy in this world. For men indeed ſometimes by evil habits, and by choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing vile things for a long time together, make it morally impoſſible to chooſe and to love that good in particular which is contrary to their evil cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes. <gap reason="foreign">

We came into the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin (meaning, without ſin properly ſo called) but now we ſin by choyce, and by election bring a kinde of neceſſity upon us. But this is not ſo in all men, and ſcarcely in any man in all inſtances; and as it is, it is but an approach to that ſtate in which men ſhall work by will without choice, or by choice without contrariety of objects. In hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and hell men will doe ſo. The Saints love God ſo fully, that they cannot hate him, nor deſire to diſpleaſe him. And in hell the accurſed ſpirits ſo perfectly hate him that they can never love him. But in this life which is <hi>ſtatus viae,</hi> a middle condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between both, and a paſſage to one of the other, it cannot be ſuppoſ'd to be ſo, unleſs here alſo a man be already ſav'd or damn'd.</p>
                  <p>But then I conſider this alſo,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> that ſince it is almoſt by all men acknowledg'd to be unjuſt that infants ſhould be eternally tormented in the flames of Hell for Original ſin; yet we do not ſay that it is unjuſt that men of age and reaſon ſhould ſo periſh, if they be vicious and diſobedient. Which difference can have no ground but this, That infants could not chooſe at all, much leſs, that which not they, but their Father did long before they were born: But men can chooſe, and doe what they are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and abſtain from what is forbidden. For if they could not, they ought no more to periſh for this, then infants for that.</p>
                  <p>And this is ſo neceſſary a truth,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="74"/> that it is one of
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:115796:238"/>the great grounds and neceſſities of obedience and holy living; and if after the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> it be not by God permitted to us to chooſe or refuſe, there is nothing left whereby man can ſerve God, or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him a ſacrifice. It is no ſervice, it is not rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, if it could not be avoided, nor the omiſſion puniſhable if it could not be done. All things elſe are determin'd, and fix'd by the Divine providence, even all the actions of men. But the inward act of the will is left under the command of laws onely, and under the arreſt of threatnings, and the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of promiſes. And that this is left for man can no ways impede any of the Divine decrees, becauſe the outward act being overruled by the Divine providence, it is ſtrange if the Schools will leave nothing to man, whereby he can glorify God.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="75"/> and more then is neceſſary to the Queſtion, if the impertinencies of ſome Schools, and their tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling arreſts had not ſo needleſly diſturb'd this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle.

<pb n="425" facs="tcp:115796:239"/>her free from venial actual ſin then from Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. Since therefore God hath granted her the greater, and that ſhe never ſinn'd actually, it is to be preſum'd God did not deny to her the ſmaller favour, and therefore ſhe was free from Original. Upon this many a pretty ſtory hath been made, and rare arguments fram'd, and ſierce conteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whether it be more agreeable to the piety and prudence of the Virgin Mother to deſire im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity from Original ſin that is deadly, or from a venial actual ſin that is not deadly. This indeed is voluntary, and the other is not; but the other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives us of grace, and this does not. God was more offended by that, but we offend him more by this. The diſpute can never be ended upon their accounts; but this Gordian knot I have now untied as <hi>Alexander</hi> did, by deſtroying it, and cutting it all in pieces. But to return to the Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> was indeed a fierce Patron of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and one of the chief inventers and finiſhers of it; and his ſenſe of it is declared in his Book <hi>De peccatorum medicinâ,</hi>

If we cheriſh them, they undoe us; if we doe not cheriſh them, they die: we ſuffer illuſion in our dreams, and abſurd fancies when we are waking; our life is ſoon done, and yet very tedious; it is too long, and too ſhort; darkneſs and light are both troubleſome; and thoſe things which are pleaſant, are often un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> whereof a great part is a natural impotency, and the other is brought in by our own folly.

<pb n="434" facs="tcp:115796:244"/>years long almoſt; but the iniquity of man brought it quickly to 500 years, from thence to 250, from thence to 120, and at laſt to ſeventy; and then God would no more ſtrike all mankinde in the ſame manner, but individuals and ſingle ſinners ſmart for it, and are cut off in their youth, and <hi>do not live out half their dayes.</hi> And ſo it is in the matters of the ſoul and the ſpirit. Every ſin leaves an evil upon the ſoul; and every age grows worſe, and addes ſome iniquity of its own to the former examples. And therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls <hi>Adam mali traducem;</hi> he tranſmitted the original and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplar, and we write after his copy. <hi>Infirmitatis ingenitae vitium;</hi> ſo <hi>Arnobius</hi> calls our natural baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we are naturally weak, and this weakneſs is a vice or defect of Nature, and our evil uſages make our natures worſe; like Butchers being us'd to kill beaſts, their natures grow more ſavage and unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful; ſo it is with us all. If our parents be good, yet we often prove bad, as the wilde olive comes from the branch of a natural olive, or as corn with the chaff come from clean grain, and the uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed from the circumciſed. But if our parents be bad, it is the leſs wonder if their children are ſo; a Blackamore begets a Blackamore, as an Epileptick ſon does often come from an Epileptick father, and hereditary diſeaſes are tranſmitted by generation; ſo it is in that viciouſneſs that is radicated in the body, for a luſtful father oftentimes begets a luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſon; and ſo it is in all thoſe inſtances where the ſoul follows the temperature of the body. And thus not onely <hi>Adam,</hi> but every father may tranſmit an <hi>Original ſin,</hi> or rather an <hi>Original viciouſneſs</hi> of his own. For a vicious nature, or a natural improbity when it is not conſented to, is not a ſin, but an ill diſpoſition: Philoſophy and the Grace of God muſt cure it; but it often cauſes us to ſin, before our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:115796:244"/>&amp; our higher principles are well attended to. But when we conſent to, and actuate our evil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we ſpoil our natures and make them worſe, making evil ſtill more natural. For it is as much in our nature to be pleaſed with our artificial delights as with our natural. And this is the doctrine of S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſpeaking of Concupiſcence.

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:115796:253"/>was unfit and unnatural, and threatning them that did things unlawful. But <hi>this way,</hi> by reaſon of the peeviſhneſs of men, ſucceeded not well, but men became worſe by it. For what the law did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid without the threatning of any penalty, they took for an advice onely, and no ſevere injunction: And thoſe Commandements which were eſtabliſhed with a threatning to the tranſgreſſors, they expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded onely by <hi>the letter,</hi> and in the <hi>particular inſtance,</hi> and in the <hi>outward act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before the Law,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> men allowed to themſelves many impieties, which reaſon indeed mark'd out to be ſuch, but no law had forbidden them in expreſs let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. They thought it lawful to ſeduce and tempt another mans wife, and invite her to his houſe and conjugation, ſo he did not ſteal, or force her away: but if they found a coldneſs between her and her husband, they would blow the coals, and enkindle an evil flame. It is ſuppoſed that <hi>Herod</hi> did ſo to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodias</hi> his brother <hi>Philips</hi> wife, even after the law. They would not by violence ſnatch the eſtate from a young prodigal heir, but if he were apt, they would lend him money, and nurſe his vice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle his eſtate, and at laſt devour it. They would not directly deny to pay the price of a purchaſe; but they would detain it or divert it, or pay it in trifling ſums, or in undeſir'd commodities. This was <hi>Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcere rem alienam.</hi> They did not ſteal, but coveted it, and ſo entred indirectly: and this God ſeeing, forbad it by a law:
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.7.</note> 
                     <hi>For I had not known luſt or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be a ſin</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>but that the law ſaid, Thou ſhalt not covet.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe the law onely forbad luſtings,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed no penalty, they deſpis'd it; and thoſe things which were forbidden with an appendent penalty, they would act them privately. For if they avoided the notice of the Criminal Judge, they fear'd not
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:115796:253"/>the face of an angry God: and this <hi>Lactantius</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd of them. <hi>Metus legum non ſcelera compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mebat, ſed licentiam ſubmovebat.

                     <q>For all the threatnings of the Law they were wicked ſtill, though not ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous; <hi>vile</hi> in <hi>private,</hi> and <hi>wary</hi> in <hi>publick;</hi> they did circumſcribe their laws, and thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound onely to the letter, and obliged by nothing but the penalty,</q> which if they eſcaped they reckoned themſelves innocent. Thus far the law <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed</hi> them, and made them <hi>afraid.</hi> But for the <hi>firſt,</hi> they grew the more greedy to doe what now they were forbidden to deſire. The prohibition of the law being like a damme to the waters, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſwels the higher for being check'd; and the wiſdome of <hi>Romulus</hi> in not caſting up a bank againſt parricide had this effect, that until the end of the ſecond Punick war which was almoſt DC. years, there was no example of one that kill'd his Father. <hi>Lucius Oſtius</hi> was the firſt. And it is certain that the Eaſterlings neither were nor had they reaſon to be fond of Circumciſion; it was part of that load which was complain'd of by the Apoſtles in behalf of the Jewiſh Nation, which neither they nor their Fathers could bear; and yet as ſoon as Chriſt took off the yoke, and that it was forbidden to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the Jews were as fond of it, as of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; and fifteen Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſucceſſion, were all circumciſed, and no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, no authority could hinder them. And for their <hi>fear,</hi> it onely produc'd caution, and ſneaking from the face of men, and both together ſet them on work to corrupt the ſpirit of the law by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions too much according to the letter: ſo that by this means, their natural deſires, their luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:115796:254"/>and concupiſcence were not cured.</p>
                  <p>For as <hi>Lactantius</hi> brought in the Heathen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſo does S. <hi>Paul</hi> bring in the Jew: <hi>That which I doe I allow not,
<note place="margin">Rom. 7.25, 19.</note> for what I would, that I doe not, but what I hate that I doe.</hi> I ſay, this is the ſtate of a man under the law; a man who is not regenerate and made free by the Spirit of Chriſt; that is, a man who abides in the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature: of which the law of nature warn'd him firſt, and the ſuperinduc'd law of God warn'd him more; but there was not in theſe Covenants or Laws ſufficient either to endure or to ſecure obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; they did not miniſter ſtrength enough to conquer ſin, to overthrow its power, to deſtroy the kingdome and reign of ſin: this was reſerv'd for the great day of triumph; it was the glory of the Goſpel the power of Chriſt, the ſtrength of the Spirit which alone was able to doe it; and by this with its appendages, that is the pardon of ſin and a victory over it, a conqueſt by the prevailing and rule of the Spirit, by this alone the Goſpel is the moſt excellent above all the covenants, and ſtates, and inſtitutions of the world.</p>
                  <p>But then the Chriſtian muſt not complain thus;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> if he be advanced into the ſecrets of the kingdome, if he be a Chriſtian in any thing beyond the name; he cannot ſay that ſin gives him laws, that it reigns in his mortal body, that he is led captive by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan at his will, that he ſins againſt his will frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and habitually, and cannot help it. But ſo it is, men doe thus complain; and which is worſe, they make this to be their excuſe, and their incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If they have ſinn'd foully, they ſay, It is true;
<note place="margin">V. 15.</note> but <hi>it is not I, but ſin that dwelleth in me. For that which I doe, I allow not; for what I would, that doe I not, and what I hate, that doe I.</hi> And if they be tempted to a ſin, they cannot be diſſwaded from it,

<note place="margin">V. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>To will is preſent with me, but how to perform that which is good I finde not.

But when <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> are oppos'd in Scripture; and the Queſtion is, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two is to be attributed to the ſervants and ſons of God, to the <hi>Regenerate?</hi> it is certain by the analogy of the thing, and the perpetual man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeaking in Scripture, that by this word <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> the Spirit of God never means <hi>the ſons of God,</hi> or the <hi>ſpiritual;</hi> that is, the <hi>Regenerate:
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> The ſons of God are led by the Spirit of God;</hi> therefore not by the fleſh, which they have crucified. Whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is eſſential to regeneration, to new birth, to the being the ſons of God, all that is in the regenerate; for they cannot be that thing, of which they want an eſſential part: as a thing cannot be a body un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be diviſible, nor a living creature if it have not life. Therefore regeneration is perfect in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of its eſſentials or neceſſary parts of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:115796:258"/>But in the degrees there is imperfection, and therefore the abatement is made by the intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of carnality. For it is in our new and ſpiritual birth, as in our natural. The childe is a man in all eſſential parts, but he is as a beaſt in ſome of his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; he hath all the faculties of a man, but not the ſtrengths of a man, but grows to it by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and encreaſe of every day. So is the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual man regenerate in his <hi>minde,</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> his <hi>affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> and therefore when <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> are oppos'd in their whole nature and definitions, the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> man is not the <hi>carnal,</hi> though he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſome of the weakneſſes of the fleſh, againſt which he contends every day.

                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> expreſſes this article. But S. <hi>Auſt.</hi> may be thought to have had ſome deſign in chooſing this ſenſe, as ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it would ſerve for an argument againſt the <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gians</hi> and their ſenſe of Free will. For by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the inevitability of ſin, he deſtroyed their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the ſufficiency of our natural powers in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to heaven, and therefore by granting that S. <hi>Paul</hi> complains thus of his own infirmity, he believed himſelf to have concluded firmly for the abſolute neceſſity of Gods grace to help us. But by limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this inevitability of ſinning to the matter of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires or concupiſcence; he gave no allowance or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to any man to ſpeak any evil words, or to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or conſent to any evil thoughts, or to commit any ſinful actions, upon the pretence of their being ſins of an unavoidable infirmity. So that though he was deſirous to ſerve the ends of his preſent queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, yet he was careful that he did not diſſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of Religion and a holy life. But beſides that the holy Scriptures abound in nothing more then in affirming our needs, and the excellency of the Divine grace, and S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> needed not to have been put to his ſhifts in this Queſtion it is conſiderable that his firſt Expoſition had done his buſineſs bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For if theſe words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> be (as indeed they are) to be expounded of an unregenerate man, one under the law, but not under grace; nothing could more have magnified Gods grace, then that
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:115796:259"/>an unregenerate perſon could not by all the force of nature, nor the aids of the law, nor the ſpirit of fear, nor temporal hopes, be redeem'd from the flavery and tyranny of ſin; and that from this ſtate there is no redemption but by the Spirit of God, and the grace of the Lord Jeſus; which is expreſly affirmed and proved by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> if you admit this ſenſe of the words.

                  <p n="1">1. The ſtate of men under the law, was but a ſtate of carnality and of nature better inſtructed, and foundly threatned and ſet forward in ſome inſtances by the ſpirit of fear only, but not cured, but in many men made much worſe accidentally.</p>

And this is the ſtate of men in nature, and was the ſtate of men under the law. For to be under the law, and not to be led by the Spirit,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.18.</note> are all one in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> account; <hi>for if ye be led by the Spirit ye are not under the law,</hi> ſaith he: And therefore to be under the law, being a ſtate of not being under the Spirit, muſt be under the government of the fleſh; that is, they were not then ſanctified by the Spirit of grace and truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt, they were not yet <hi>redeemed from their vain converſation.</hi> Not that this was the ſtate of all the ſons of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> of them that liv'd before the law, or after; but that the law
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:115796:263"/>could doe no more for them, or upon them; Gods Spirit did in many of them work his own works, but this was by the grace of Jeſus Chriſt, who was <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world:</hi> this was not by the works of the law, but by the ſame inſtruments and grace, by which <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and all they who are his children by promiſe were juſtified.

From hence I draw this argument. That ſtate from which we are redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt, and freed by the Spirit of his grace, is a ſtate of carnality, of unregeneration, that is, of ſin and death: But by Jeſus Chriſt we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from that ſtate in which we were in ſubjection to ſin, commanded by the law of ſin,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:115796:264"/>and obeyed it againſt our reaſon, and againſt our conſcience; therefore this ſtate, which is indeed the ſtate S. <hi>Paul</hi> here deſcribes, is the ſtate of carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and unregeneration, and therefore not competent to the ſervants of Chriſt, to the elect people of God, to them who are redeemed and ſanctified by the Spirit of Chriſt. The parts of this argument are the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and proved in the foregoing pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods. From hence I ſhall deſcend to ſomething that is more immediately practical, and cloth'd with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>

<pb n="475" facs="tcp:115796:264"/>one that does ſomething, but not all; not enough for the obtaining ſalvation.

Now becauſe theſe men mean well, and fain would be quit of their ſin at their own rate, and are not ſcandalous, and impious, they flatter themſelves, and think all is well with them, that they are regenerate, and in the ſtate of the Divine favour, and if they die ſo, their accounts are bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanc'd, and they doubt not but they ſhall reign as

To reprove this ſtate of folly and danger, we are to obſerve, that there are a great many ſteps of this progreſſion, which are to be paſſed through, and the end is not yet; the man is not yet arrived at the ſtate of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> An unregenerate man may be convinc'd and clearly inſtructed in his duty, and approve the law, and confeſs the obligation, and conſent that it ought to be done: which S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals <hi>a conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the law that it is good,</hi> and a being <hi>deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in it according to the inward man;</hi> even the Gentiles which have not the law, yet <hi>ſhew the work of the law written in their hearts:

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> and glory in God, knowing his will, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the things that are more excellent.</hi> And there are too many who being called Chriſtians <hi>know their Maſters will, and doe it not:</hi> and this conſenting to the law and approving it, is ſo farre from being a ſign of regeneration, that the vileſt and the baſeſt of men are thoſe who ſin moſt againſt their knowledge, and againſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences. In this world a man may have faith great enough to remove mountains, and yet be without charity: and in the world to come ſome ſhall be rejected from the preſence of God, though they ſhall ailege for themſelves, that they have prophecied in the name of Chriſt. * This <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the law</hi> which is in the unregenerate, is onely in the underſtanding. The man conſiders what an excellent thing it is to be vertuous, the juſt proportions of duty, the fitneſs of being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to God, the rectitude of the ſoul, the acquieſcence and appendent peace: and this delight is juſt like that which is in finding out
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:115796:265"/>proportions in Arithmetick and Geometry, or the reſt in diſcovering the ſecrets of a myſterious propoſition: a man hath great pleaſure in ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory notices, and the end of his diſquiſition. So alſo it is in moral things: a good man is belov'd by every one; and there is a ſecret excellency and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, a muſick and proportion between a mans minde and wiſe counſels, which impious and profane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons cannot perceive, becauſe they are ſo full of falſe meaſures and weak diſcourſes, and vile appetites, and a rude inconſideration of the reaſonableneſs and wiſdome of ſobriety and ſevere courſes. But
<q>—virtus laudatur &amp; alget,</q> this is all that ſome men doe, and there is in them nothing but a preparation of the underſtanding to the things of God, a faith ſeated in the rational part, a conviction of the minde; which as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to lead on the will to action, and the other faculties to obedience, ſo now that the effect is not acquired, it ſerves onely to upbraid the man for a knowing and diſcerning Criminal, he hath not now the excuſe of ignorance. He that complies with an Uſurper out of fear and intereſt, in actions prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the lawful Prince, and tells the honeſt party, that he is right in his heart, though he be forc'd to comply, helps the other with an argument to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince him that he is a falſe man. He that does it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and according to a preſent conſcience, hath ſome excuſe; but he that confeſſes that he is right in his perſwaſion, and wrong in his practiſe, is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>condemn'd by himſelf,</hi> and profeſſes himſelf a guilty perſon, a man whom intereſt and not conſcience governs. Better it is not to know at all, then not to purſue the good we know. They that
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:115796:266"/>know not God, are infinitely far from him; but they who know him, and yet doe not obey him, are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the nearer for their knowledge, ſometimes the further off, but as yet they are not arrived whither it is intended they ſhould go.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> An <hi>unregenerate man</hi> may with his will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in goodneſs, and deſire it earneſtly. For in an <hi>unregenerate man</hi> there is a double appetite, and there may be the apprehenſion of two amabilities. The things of the Spirit pleaſe his minde, and his will may conſequently deſire that this good were done becauſe it ſeems beauteous to the rational part, to his Minde: but becauſe he hath alſo reliſhes and guſts in the fleſh, and they alſo ſeem ſapid and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful, he deſires them alſo. So that this man fain would and he would not; and he does ſin wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and unwillingly at the ſame time. We ſee by a ſad experience, ſome men all their life time ſtand at gaze, and dare not enter upon that courſe of life which themſelves by a conſtant ſentence judge to be the beſt, and of the moſt conſiderable advantage. But as the boy in the Apologue liſtned to the diſputes of Labour and Idleneſs, the one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwading him to riſe, the other to lie in bed; but while he conſidered what to doe, he ſtill lay in bed and conſidered: ſo theſe men diſpute and argue for vertue and the ſervice of God, and ſtand beholding and admiring it, but they ſtand on the other ſide while they behold it. There is a ſtrife between the law of the minde, and the law of the members. But <hi>this</hi> prevails over <hi>that.</hi> For the caſe is thus: There are in men three laws; 1. The law of the members. 2. The law of the minde. 3.

But the Minde being worſted, God ſends in the auxiliaries of the Spirit; and when that enters and poſſeſſes, that overcomes the fleſh, it rules and gives laws. But as in the unregenerate the Minde did ſtrive though it was overpower'd, yet ſtill it contended, but ineffectively for the moſt part: ſo now when the Spirit rules, the fleſh ſtrives, but it prevails but ſeldome, it is overpowered by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.

<pb n="481" facs="tcp:115796:267"/>fleſh prevails, then there was in us nothing but <hi>the law of the minde;</hi> nothing but the conſcience of an unregenerate perſon: I mean, if the fleſh prevails frequently or habitually. But if the Spirit of God did rule us, if that principle had poſſeſſion of us, then the fleſh is crucified, it is mortified, it is killed, and prevails not at all but when we will not uſe the force and arms of the Spirit, but it does not prevail <hi>habitually,</hi> not <hi>frequently</hi> or <hi>regularly,</hi> or by <hi>obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> This is clearly taught by thoſe excellent words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> which, as many other periods of his Epiſtles, have had the ill luck to be very much miſunderſtood. <q>

To doe one, is not to doe the other; who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fulfils the luſts of the fleſh, and is rul'd by that law, he is not ruled by the grace of Chriſt, he is not regenerate by the Spirit. But the other ſenſe is the beſt reddition of the word; <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if he had ſaid, <hi>Walk in the Spirit,</hi> and then <hi>the event will be,</hi> that the <hi>fleſh ſhall not prevail</hi> over you, or give you laws; <hi>you ſhall not then fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> And this is beſt agreeable to the purpoſe of the Apoſtle. For having exhorted the <hi>Galatians</hi> that they ſhould not make <hi>their Chriſtian liberty a pretence to the fleſh:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> as the beſt remedy againſt their enemy the fleſh, he preſcribes this <hi>walking in the Spirit,</hi> which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:115796:268"/>deletery and prevalency over the fleſh. And the reaſon follows: <hi>for the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh; ſo that ye cannot doe the things that ye would;</hi> that is, though ye be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to, and deſirous of ſatisfying your carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, yet being under the empire and conduct of the Spirit, ye cannot doe thoſe deſires; the Spirit over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rules you, and you muſt, you will contradict your carnal appetites. For elſe this could not be (as the Apoſtle deſigns it) a reaſon of his exhortation. For if he had meant that in this contention of fleſh and Spirit, we could not doe the <hi>good things</hi> that we would, then the reaſon had contradicted the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. For ſuppoſe it thus; <hi>Walk in the Spirit, and fulfil not the luſts of the fleſh. For the fleſh and the Spirit luſt againſt each other, ſo that ye cannot doe the good ye would.</hi> This, I ſay, is not ſenſe, for the latter part contradicts the former. For, this thing <hi>[that the fleſh hinders us from doing the things of the Spirit]</hi> is ſo far from being a reaſon why we ſhould <hi>walk in the Spirit,</hi> that it perfectly diſcourages that deſign; and it is to little purpoſe to <hi>walk in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> if this will not ſecure us againſt the domineering and tyranny of the fleſh. But the contrary is moſt clear and conſequent: <hi>If ye walk in the Spirit, ye ſhall not fulfil the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> for though <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit,</hi> and would fain prevail, yet it cannot; for <hi>the Spirit</hi> alſo <hi>luſteth againſt the fleſh,</hi> and is ſtronger, ſo that <hi>ye may not,</hi> or that <hi>ye doe not,</hi> or that <hi>ye cannot</hi> (for any of theſe readings as it may properly render the words of <gap reason="foreign">

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> 1. An <hi>impious, profane perſon</hi> ſins without any contention; that is, with a clear, ready,

The contention in him is between Reaſon and Paſſion, the law of the minde and the law of the members, between conſcience and ſin, <hi>that</hi> weak, <hi>this</hi> prevailing. 3. But the <hi>Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> hath the ſame contention within him, and the temptation is ſometimes ſtrong within him, yet he overcomes it, and ſeldome fails in any material and conſiderable inſtances.

                     <hi>God is able to doe above all that we can ask or think; he can keep us from all ſin, and preſent us unblameable in the ſight of his glory.</hi> So that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the <hi>power of the Spirit,</hi> in breaking the tyranny, and ſubduing the luſts of the fleſh, beſides that it contradicts all theſe and divers other Scriptures, it

                  <p>But how happens it then that even the regenerate ſins often,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="32"/> and the fleſh prevails upon the ruine, or the declenſions of the Spirit? I anſwer, It is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that holy principle which is in the regenerate cannot or will not ſecure him, but becauſe the man is either prepoſſeſs'd with the temptation, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come before he begins to oppoſe the arms of the Spirit, that is, becauſe he is ſurpris'd, or incogitant, or it may be, careleſs; <hi>the good man is aſleep,</hi> and then the <hi>enemy</hi> takes his advantage and <hi>ſows tares;</hi> for if he were awake, and conſidering, and would make uſe of the ſtrengths of the Spirit, he would not be overcome by ſin. For there are powers enough, that is, arguments and endearments, helps and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient motives to enable us to reſiſt the ſtrongeſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation in the world; and this one alone, of <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to eternal life,</hi> which is revealed to us by Jeſus Chriſt, and miniſtred in the Goſpel, is an argument greater then all the promiſes and inticements of ſin, if we will attend to its efficacy and conſequence. But if we throw away our arms, and begin a fight in the Spirit, and end it in the fleſh, the ill ſucceſs of the day is to be imputed to us, not to the Spirit of God, to whom if we had attended we ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have prevailed. * The reliques and remains of ſin are in the regenerate; but that is a ſign that ſin is overcome, and the kingdome of it broken; and that is a demonſtration, that when ever ſin does prevail in any ſingle inſtances, it is not for want of power, but of uſing that power; for ſince the Spirit
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:115796:269"/>hath prevailed upon the fleſh in its ſtrengths, and hath crucified it, there is no queſtion but it can alſo prevail upon all its weakneſſes.</p>
                  <p>For we muſt be curious to avoid a miſtake here:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> The dominion of the Spirit, and the remains of the fleſh may conſiſt together in the regenerate; as ſome remains of cold with the prevailing heat; but the dominion of one and the other, are in every degree inconſiſtent; as both cold and heat cannot in any ſenſe be both ſaid to be the prevailing ingredient. A man cannot be ſaid to be both free from ſin, and a ſlave to ſin; If he hath prevailed in any degree upon ſin, then he is not at all a ſervant of that portion from whence he is ſet free; but if he be a captive of any one ſin, or regular degree of it, he is not Gods freed man; for the Spirit prevails upon all as well as upon one; and that is not an infinite power that cannot redeem us from all our ſlavery: But to be a ſlave of ſin, and at the ſame time to be a ſervant of righteouſneſs, is not onely againſt the analogy of Scripture, and the expreſs ſignification of ſo many excellent periods, but againſt common ſenſe; it is as if one ſhould ſay, that a man hath more heat then cold in his hand, and yet that the cold ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon, and be ſtronger then the heat; that is, that the weaker ſhould overcome the ſtronger, and the leſs ſhould be greater, then that which is bigger then it.</p>
                  <p>But as the choice of vertue is abated,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> and (as the temptation grows more violent, and urges more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemently) is made leſs pleaſant in the regenerate perſon; ſo is the choice of vice in the <hi>Moral,</hi> or <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal man.</hi> The contention abates the pleaſure in both their choices; but in the one it ends in ſin, in the other it ends in victory. So that there is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to ſin in all but in the <hi>impious</hi> and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane</hi> perſon, in the far diſtant ſtranger. But the
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:115796:270"/>unwillingneſs to ſin, that is in the <hi>Animal,</hi> or <hi>Moral man,</hi> is nothing elſe but a ſerving ſin like a grum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſervant, or like the younger ſon of the Farmer in the Goſpel; he ſaid he would not, but did it for all his angry words. And therefore that the unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man acts the ſin againſt his minde, and after a long contention againſt it, does not in all caſes leſſen it,
<note place="margin">Cauſ. 24. q. 1. C. Schiſma.</note> but ſometimes increaſes it. <hi>Nec leviat crimen corum, magis verò auget, quòd eos diùreſtitiſſe dixiſtis,</hi> ſaid Pope <hi>Pelagius.</hi> To reſiſt long, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, hath in it ſome aggravations of the crime, as being a conviction of the mans baſeneſs, a violence to reaſon, a breach of former reſolutions, a receſſion from fair beginnings, and wholly without excuſe. * But if ever it comes to paſs, that in the contention of <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> the <hi>regenerate</hi> man does ſin, he does it unwillingly, that is, by ignorance or inadvertency: The unregenerate ſins unwillingly too, but it is by reaſon of the dominion and rule that ſin bears over him: but ſtill this difference diſtinguiſhes them in the event of things, that when it comes to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion whether ſin ſhall be done or no, the one wills, and the other wills not, though it may happen that the conſent or diſſent reſpectively may be with the ſame unwillingneſs by reaſon of the contention and ſtrife from the adverſe, though weaker party. The unregenerate man may be unwilling to obey ſin, but he obeys it for all that; and the unwillingneſs is a ſign of the greater ſlavery; but there can be no ſign of his regeneration, but by not obeying the ſin in the day of its own power and temptation. A ſervant is ſtill a ſervant whether he obeys with, or againſt his will. <hi>His ſervants we are to whom we obey,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Paul;</hi> all therefore that is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the Queſtion of regeneration, is, whether the man obeys, or not obeys? for whether he be willing or unwilling, is not here conſiderable. Let
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:115796:270"/>no man therefore flatter himſelf that he is a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate perſon, becauſe though he is a ſervant to ſin, and acts at the command of his luſt, and cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the evil day, or ſtand the ſhock of a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet he finds an unwillingneſs within him, and a ſtrife againſt ſin. <hi>Hugo de S. Victore,</hi> or elſe S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> in the Book <hi>de continentiâ,</hi> gave beginning or countenance to this error. <hi>Hanc pugnam non experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>untur in ſemetipſis niſi bellatores virtutum, debellato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>réſque vitiorum.</hi> This fight none finde in themſelves, but they that fight on vertues ſide, and deſtroy vice. Which words, though ſomething crudely ſet down, and ſo not true, yet are explicable by the following period; <hi>Non expugnat concupiſcentiae malum, niſi continentiae bonum:</hi> onely holy and continent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons doe overcome their concupiſcence; and in that ſenſe it is true: Onely the regenerate feel this fight which ends in victory. But he whoſe contention ends in ſin, and after a brave onſet, yeelds baſely, <hi>frequently</hi> I mean, or <hi>habitually,</hi> every ſuch perſon is a ſervant of ſin, and therefore not a ſervant of the ſpirit, but free from, that is, not rul'd by the law of righteouſneſs. And this is ſo certain, that this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs to ſin, which ends in obeying it, is ſo far from being a note of a regenerate perſon, that it is evidently true, that no man can come from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude or ſlavery of ſin, but the firſt ſtep of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it, is the ſenſe and hatred of his fetters, and then his deſire of being freed: but therefore he is not free, becauſe he complains of his bands, and finds them heavy and intolerable, and therefore ſeeks for remedy. For if an <hi>unregenerate perſon</hi> did always ſin willingly, that is, without this reluctancy and ſtrife within; and <hi>the regenerate</hi> did ſin as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly, but yet ſore againſt his will; then the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon</hi> were the verier ſlave of the two: for he that obeys willingly, is leſs a ſlave, then
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:115796:271"/>he that obeys in ſpight of his heart.

To leave a ſin out of fear of the Divine judgement is not ſinful, or totally unacceptable.

So <hi>Jehu</hi> obeyed God a great way: but there was a turning, and a high ſtile, beyond which he would not goe, and his principles could not carry him through.

For to have received the holy Ghoſt, is not an inſeparable propriety of the regenerate. The Spirit of God is an internal agent; that is, the effects and graces of the Spirit by which we are aſſiſted, are within us before they operate. For although all aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances from without are graces of God, the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> 1. A regenerate perſon is convinc'd of the goodneſs of the law, and <hi>meditates in it day and night.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. He ſometimes feels the rebellions of the fleſh, but he fights againſt them alwayes; and if he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a fall, he riſes inſtantly, and fights the more fiercely, and watches the more cautelouſly, and prays the more paſſionately, and arms himſelf more ſtrongly, and prevails more proſperouſly. In a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate perſon there is fleſh and Spirit, but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit onely rules. There is an outward and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, but both of them are ſubject to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. There was <hi>a law of the members,</hi> but it is abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and cancell'd; the law is repeal'd, and does not any more inſlave him <hi>to the law of ſin.

                  <p n="4">4. A regenerate perſon does not onely approve that which is beſt, and deſire to doe it, but he does it actually, and delights to doe it; he continues and abides in it, which the Scripture calls <hi>a walking in the Spirit,</hi> and a living after it: for he does his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the ſtrengths of the Spirit; that is, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations Evangelical, in the love of God, in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Chriſt, and by the aids he hath receiv'd from above beyond the powers of nature and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and therefore he does his duty upon ſuch conſiderations as are apt to make it integral and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering. For,</p>
                  <p n="5">5. A regenerate man does not onely leave ſome ſins but all, and willingly entertains none. He does not onely quit a luſt that is againſt his diſpoſition, but that which he is moſt inclined to, he is moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere againſt, and moſt watchful to deſtroy it; he plucks out his right eye and cuts off his right hand, and parts with his biggeſt intereſt, rather then keep a luſt: and therefore conſequently chooſes vertue by the ſame method,
<note place="margin">S. Aug. ibid.</note> by which he abſtains from vice. <hi>Nam ipſa continentia cum fraenat, cohibétque libidines ſimul &amp; appetit bonum, ad cujus immortalitatem ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus: &amp; reſpuit malum cum quo in hâc mortalitate contendimus;</hi> that is. <q>He purſues all vertue, as he refuſes all vice; for he tends to the immortality of good, as he ſtrives againſt evil in all the dayes of his mortality.</q> And therefore he does not chooſe to exerciſe that vertue onely that will doe him reputation, or conſiſt with his intereſt, or pleaſe his humour, but entertains all vertue, whether it be
<pb n="497" facs="tcp:115796:275"/>with him or againſt him, pleaſing or diſpleaſing; <hi>he chooſes all that God hath commanded him, becauſe he does it for that reaſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. A regenerate perſon doth not onely contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his appetite in ſingle inſtances, but endevours to deſtroy the whole body of ſin; he does not onely <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> his fond appetite, but he <hi>mortifies</hi> it, and never entertains conditions of peace with it; for it is a dangerous miſtake, if we ſhall preſume all is well, becauſe we doe ſome acts of ſpite to our dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt luſt, and ſometimes croſs the moſt pleaſing temptation, and oppoſe our ſelves in ſingle inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt every ſin. <hi>This is not it;</hi> the regenerate man endevours to deſtroy the whole body of ſin, and having had an opportunity to conteſt his ſin, and to contradict it this day, is glad he hath done ſomething of his duty, and does ſo again to morrow and ever, till he hath quite killed it; and never entertains conditions of peace with it, nor ever is at reſt till the fleſh be quiet and obedient. * For ſometimes it comes to paſs that the old man being uſed to obey, at laſt obeys willingly, and takes the conditions of the <hi>Gibeonites;</hi> it is content to doe drudgery and the inferior miniſteries, if it may be ſuffered to abide in the land.</p>
                  <p>So that here is a new account upon which the former propoſition is verifiable;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> viz. <hi>It is not the propriety of the regenerate to feel a contention within him concerning doing good or bad.</hi> For it is not onely true, that the unregenerate oftentimes feel the fight, and never ſee the triumph; but it is alſo true, that ſometimes the regenerate doe not feel this contention. They did once with great violence and trouble; but when they have gotten a clear victory, they have alſo great meaſures of peace. But this is but ſeldome, to few perſons, and in them but in rare inſtances, in carnal ſins and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:115796:276"/>for in ſpiritual, they will never have an intire reſt till they come into their Country. It is <hi>Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical perfection</hi> to have no fleſh at all, but it is <hi>the perfection of a Chriſtian</hi> to have the fleſh obedient to the ſpirit always, and in all things. But if this contention be not a ſign of regeneration, but is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to good and bad, that which can onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh them, is victory, and perſeverance; and thoſe ſins which are committed at the end of ſuch contentions, are not ſins of a pitiable and excuſable infirmity; but the iſſues of death and direct emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from an unregenerate eſtate. Therefore</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="42"/> Laſtly; The regenerate not onely hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit of God, but is wholly led by him, he attends his motions, he obeys his counſels, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in his Commandements, and accepts his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and conſents to his truth, and rejoyces in his comforts, and is nouriſh'd by his hopes up to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man in Chriſt Jeſus. This is the onely condition of being the ſons of God,
<note place="margin">Ro. 8.14.</note> and being ſav'd. <hi>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> None elſe. And therefore <hi>if ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die, but if through the Spirit ye do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi> This is your chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteriſtick note. Our obedience to the Spirit, our walking by his light, and by his conduct. <hi>This is the Spirit that witneſſeth to our ſpirit,

                  <p>For moſt men are pleaſed to call their debau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries <hi>ſins of infirmity,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> if they be done againſt their reaſon, and the actual murmur of their conſciences, and againſt their trifling reſolutions, and ineffective purpoſes to the contrary. Now although all ſins are the effects of infirmity <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Moral,</hi> yet becauſe I am to cure a popular miſtake, I am alſo to underſtand the word as men doe commonly, and by <hi>ſins of Infirmity</hi> to mean,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such ſins which in the whole,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> and upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are unavoidable, and therefore excuſable: Such which can conſiſt with the ſtate of grace, that is, ſuch which have ſo much irregularity in them as to be ſins, and yet ſo much excuſe and pity, as that by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Mercies of the Goſpel, they ſhall not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:115796:277"/>in the worſt of puniſhments,</hi> or puniſhed with eternal pains, becauſe they cannot with the greateſt moral diligence wholly be avoided. Concerning theſe ſo deſcribed, we are to take accounts by the following meaſures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> Natural imperfections, and evil inclinations, when they are not conſented to or delighted in, either are no ſins at all, or if they be, they are but ſins of infirmity. That in ſome things our nature is croſs to the divine Commandement, is not always imputable to us, becauſe our natures were before the Commandement; and God hath therefore commanded us to doe violence to our nature, that by ſuch preternatural contentions we ſhould offer to God a ſervice that coſts us ſomething. But that in ſome things we are inclin'd otherwiſe then we are ſuffered to act, is ſo far from offending God, that it is that opportunity of ſerving him, by which we can moſt endear him. To be inclined to that whither nature bends, is of it ſelf indifferent, but to love, to entertain, to act our inclinations, when the Commandement is put between, that is the ſin; and therefore if we reſiſt them, and maſter them, that is our obedience. For it is equally certain; no man can be eſteemed <hi>ſpiritual</hi> for his good wiſhes and deſires of holineſs, but for his <hi>actual and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> obedience: ſo no man is to be eſteemed <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> or <hi>criminal</hi> for his natural inclinations to what is forbidden. But that good men complain of their ſtrange propenſities to ſin, it is a declaration of their fears, of their natural weakneſs, of the needs of grace, and the aids of Gods Spirit. But becauſe theſe deſires, even when they are much reſtrained, doe yet ſometimes inſenſibly go too far; therefore it is, that ſuch are <hi>ſins of infirmity,</hi> becauſe they are almoſt unavoidable. This remain is like the image of the ape which <hi>Theophilus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria</hi>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:115796:278"/>left after the breaking of the other idols; a teſtimony of their folly; but as that was left for no other purpoſe but to reprove them, ſo is this to humble us, that we may not rely upon fleſh and blood, but make God to be our confidence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> Sins of infirmity are rather obſerved in the imperfection of our duty, then in the commiſſion of any criminal action. For in this it was that our bleſſed Saviour inſtanc'd theſe words,
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.21.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſpirit truly is willing, but the fleſh is weak;</hi> The body is weary, the eies heavy, the fancy reſtleſs, diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons many, buſineſſes perpetually intervene, and all the powers of diſcourſe and obſervation cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our minde from wandring in our prayers,
<q>
                        <l>—Odi artus, fragilémque hunc corporis uſum</l>
                        <l>Deſertorem animi—</l>
                     </q> But this being in the whole unavoidable, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in many of its parts and inſtances very excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, if we doe not indulge to it; if we pray and ſtrive againſt it; that is, ſo long as it is a natural infirmity. For although we cannot avoid wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts, yet we can avoid delighting in them, or a careleſs and negligent increaſing them. For if they once ſeiſe upon the will, they are ſins of choice and malice, and not of infirmity. So that the great ſcene of ſins of infirmity, is in omiſſion of degrees and portions of that excellency of duty which is required of us. We are imperfect, and we do imperfectly, and if we ſtrive towards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, God will pity our imperfection. There is no other help for us; but bleſſed be God, <hi>that</hi> is ſufficient for our need, and proportionable to our preſent ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But in actions and matters of commiſſion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> the caſe is different. For though a man may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:115796:278"/>himſelf againſt his will, or ſleep, or fall, yet without his will he cannot throw himſelf down, or riſe again. Every action is more or leſs volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, but every omiſſion is not. A thing may be let alone upon a dead ſtock, or a negative principle, or an unavoidable defect, but an action cannot be done without ſome command or action of the will; therefore although ſins of defect are in many caſes pitied and not exacted, yet ſinful actions have not ſo eaſy a ſentence; but they alſo have ſome abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Imperfect actions,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> ſuch which are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete in their whole capacity, are ſins of infirmity, and ready and prepar'd for pity: of this ſort are <hi>raſh,</hi> or <hi>ignorant actions,</hi> done by <hi>ſurpriſe,</hi> by <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</hi> and <hi>inadvertency;</hi> by a ſudden and great fear, in which the reaſon is in very many degrees made uſeleſs, and the action cannot be conſidered duly. In theſe there is ſome little mixture of choice, ſo much as to make the action imputable, if God ſhould deal ſeverely with us; but yet ſo little that it ſhall not be imputed under the mercies of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; although the man that does them cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend he is innocent, yet he can pretend that he does ſtand fair in the eye of mercy. A good man may ſometimes be unwary, or he may ſpeak, or be put to it to reſolve or doe before he can well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. If he does a thing raſhly when he can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and deliberate, he is not excuſed: but if he does it indiſcreetly, when he muſt doe it ſuddenly, it is his infirmity, and he ſhall be relieved at the Chancery of the throne of Grace. For it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that Gods juſtice is in ſome caſes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="504" facs="tcp:115796:279"/>So <hi>Juſtice</hi> is taken in S. <hi>John</hi> [If we confeſs our ſins, he is <hi>righteous</hi> or <hi>juſt</hi> to forgive our ſins] that is. Gods juſtice is ſuch as to be content with what we can doe, and not to exact all that is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to be impoſed. He is as juſt in forgiving the penitent, as in puniſhing the refractary; as juſt in abating reaſonably, as in weighing ſcrupulouſly: ſuch a juſtice it is, which in the ſame caſe, <hi>David</hi> cals <hi>Mercy.</hi> For thou Lord art merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for thou rewardeſt every man according to his works.

<pb n="506" facs="tcp:115796:280"/>of death; becauſe the Devil entred on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and is as ſuddenly caſt forth. But if from the firſt arreſt of concupiſcence, he paſs on to an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect conſent, from an imperfect conſent, to a perfect and deliberate, and from thence to an act, and ſo to a habit, he ends in death; becauſe long before it is come thus far, <hi>The ſalt water is taken in.</hi> The firſt concupiſcence is but like rain water it diſcolours the pure ſprings, but makes them not deadly. But when in the progreſſion <hi>the will</hi> mingles with it, it is like the <gap reason="foreign">

For though a man may be ſurpriſed with a wanton eye, yet he cannot fight a duel againſt his knowledge, or commit adultery againſt his will. A man cannot againſt his will contrive the death of a man; but he may ſpeak a raſh word, or be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly angry, or triflingly peeviſh, and yet all this notwithſtanding, be a good man ſtill. Theſe may be ſins of Infirmity, becauſe they are imperfect actions in the whole; and ſuch, in which as the man is for the preſent ſurpris'd, ſo they are ſuch againſt which no watchfulneſs was a ſufficient guard, as it ought to have been in any great matter, and might have been in ſudden murders. A wiſe and a good man may eaſily be miſtaken in a nice queſtion, but can never ſuſpect an article of his Creed to be falſe: a good man may have many fears and doubtings in matters of ſmaller moment, but he never doubts of Gods goodneſs, of his truth, of his mercy, or of any of his communicated perfections: he may fall into melancholy, and may ſuffer indefinite fears, of he knows not what himſelf, yet he can never expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citely doubt of any thing which God hath clearly
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:115796:280"/>revealed, and in which he is ſufficiently inſtructed. A weak eye may at a diſtance miſtake a man for a tree; but he who ſailing in a ſtorm, takes the Sea for dry land, or a muſhrome for an oak, is ſtark blinde. And ſo is he who can think adultery to be excuſable, or that Treaſon can be duty, or that by perſecuting Gods Prophets, he does God good ſervice, or that he propagates religion by making the Miniſters of the Altar poor, and robbing the Churches. A good man ſo remaining cannot ſuffer infirmity in the plain and legible lines of duty, where he can ſee, and reaſon, and conſider.</p>
                  <p>I have now told which are ſins of infirmity; and I have told all their meaſures. For as for thoſe other falſe opinions by which men flatter themſelves into hell, by a pretence of ſins of infirmity, they are as unreaſonable as they are dangerous; and they are eaſily reproved upon the ſtock of the former truths. Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> Although our meer natural inclination to things forbidden, be of it ſelf a natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable infirmity, and ſuch which cannot be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by all the precepts and endevours of perfection; yet this very inclination, if it be heightned by care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs or evil cuſtomes, is not a ſin of infirmity. <hi>Tiberius</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> being troubled with a fellow that wittily and boldly pretended himſelf to be a Prince, at laſt when he could not by queſtions, he diſcovered him to be a mean perſon by the ruſticity and hardneſs of his body: not by a callouſneſs of his feet, or a wart upon a finger, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, his whole body was hard and ſervile, and ſo he was diſcovered. The natural ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and accreſcencies that inevitably adhere to our natures, are not ſufficient indications of a ſervile perſon, or a ſlave to ſin; but when our
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:115796:281"/>natures are abuſed by choice and cuſtome, when the callouſneſs is ſpread by evil and hard uſages, when the arms are brawny by the ſervices of <hi>Egypt,</hi> then it is no longer <hi>infirmity,</hi> but a ſuperinduc'd <hi>viciouſneſs,</hi> and a direct <hi>hoſtility.</hi> When nature rules, grace does not. When the fleſh is in power, the ſpirit is not. Therefore it matters not from what corner the blaſting winde does come, from whence ſoever it is, it is deadly. Moſt of our ſins are from natural inclinations; and the negative pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of God, are for the moſt part, reſtraints upon them. Therefore to pretend nature, when our ſelves have ſpoil'd it, is no excuſe, but that ſtate of evil from whence the Spirit of God is to reſcue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> Yea, but although it be thus in nature, yet it is hop'd by too many, that it ſhall be allowed to be infirmity, when the violence of our paſſions or deſires overcomes our reſolutions. Againſt this, I oppoſe this propoſition: <hi>When violence of deſire or paſſion engages us in a ſin, whither we ſee and obſerve our ſelves entring, that violence or tranſportation is not our excuſe, but our diſeaſe:</hi> and that reſolution is not accepted for innocence or repentance: but the not performing what we did reſolve is our ſin, and the violence of paſſion was the accurſed prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>to reſolve</hi> is a relative and imperfect duty,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="55"/> in order to ſomething elſe. It had not been neceſſary to reſolve, if it had not been neceſſary to doe it: and if it be neceſſary to doe it, it is not ſufficient to reſolve it. And for the underſtanding of this the better, we muſt obſerve, that <hi>to reſolve,</hi> and <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devour,</hi> are ſeveral things. To <hi>reſolve,</hi> is to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to doe what we may if we will; ſome way or other the thing is in our power; either we are able of our ſelves, or we are help'd. No man <hi>reſolves</hi> to
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:115796:281"/>carry an Elephant, or to be as wiſe as <hi>Solomon,</hi> or to deſtroy a vaſt Army with his own hands. He may <hi>endevour</hi> this; for, To <hi>endevour</hi> ſometimes ſuppoſes a ſtate of excellency, beyond our power, but not beyond our aymes. Thus we muſt <hi>endevour</hi> to avoid all ſin, and to maſter all our infirmities; becauſe to doe ſo is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of a Chriſtian courage, and that deſigne which is the proper effect of Charity, which is the beſt of Chriſtian graces. But we cannot <hi>reſolve</hi> to doe it, becauſe it is beyond all our powers; but may <hi>endevour</hi> it, and <hi>reſolve</hi> to <hi>endevour</hi> it, but that's all we can doe. But if to <hi>reſolve,</hi> be a duty, then to <hi>perform</hi> it, is a greater; and if a man cannot be the childe of God without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving againſt all the habits of ſin, then neither can he be his childe, unleſs he actually quit them all.</p>
                  <p>But then if from acting our reſolution we be hindred by paſſion and violent deſires,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="56"/> we are plainly in the ſtate of immortification. Paſſion is the Ruler: and as the firſt ſtep of victory is to keep thoſe paſſions and appetites from doing any Criminal action abroad: ſo the worſt they can doe, is to engage and force the man to ſin, and that againſt his will, even whether he liſt or no. But concerning this Article, we are intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd by the words of S. <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">Gal. 5.24.</note> He that is in Chriſt hath crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts;</hi> that is, the paſſions and deſires of the fleſh are mortified in all the regenerate: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>a ſtate of paſſion is a ſtate of death.</hi> But whatever the principle be, yet we muſt be infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful we doe not miſtake a broken reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for an intire piety. He that perpetually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, and yet perpetually breaks his reſolution, does all the way ſin againſt his conſcience, and againſt
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:115796:282"/>his reaſon, againſt his experience, and againſt his obſervation; and it will be a ſtrange offer at an excuſe, for a man to hope for, or to pretend to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, becauſe he ſinned againſt his Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>There is in this Article ſome little difference in the caſe of young perſons,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> the violence of whoſe paſſions as it tranſports them infallibly to evil, ſo it helps to excuſe ſome of it; but this is upon a double account: 1. Becauſe part of it is natural, <hi>naturale vitium aetatis,</hi> the defect and inherent incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of their age. 2. And becauſe their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions being ever ſtrongeſt when their reaſon is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt, the actions of young men are imperfect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compleat. For deliberation being nothing elſe but an alternate ſucceſſion of appetites, it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal entercourſe that a poſſeſſing, natural, promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted paſſion ſhould conteſt againſt a weak, overborn, beginning, unexperienc'd, uninſtructed reaſon: this alternation of appetites is like the duſt of a ballance weighing againſt a rock; the deliberation it ſelf muſt needs be imperfect, becauſe there is no equality.

                     <hi>The greatneſs or violence of a temptation does not excuſe our ſin,</hi> or reconcile it to the ſtate of grace and an actual conſiſtence with Gods favour. <hi>The man that is highly tempted and ſo falls, cannot ſay it was by an unavoidable infirmity.</hi> For God never ſuffers any man to be tempted above his ſtrength; and therefore when he ſuffers him to fall into a great trial, he hath before-hand prepared him with great aides: and a temptation is not ſuch a formidable thing to a conſidering Chriſtian. All that it can ſay is nothing, but that ſin is pleaſant: and ſuppoſe that true; yet ſo is drink to an hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pic perſon, and ſalt meats to a phantaſtic ſtomach, and yet they that are concerned do eaſily abſtain from theſe temptations, and remember that it is a greater pleaſure to be in health then with a little cold water, or a broyl'd fiſh to pleaſe their palate: and therefore a temptation which can be overcome by an argument from ſo ſmall an intereſt, cannot ſtand the ſhock of a Noble and a Chriſtian reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſcourſe. But every temptation puts on its ſtrength as the man is. Sometimes a full meal will not prejudice our health; and at another time half ſo much would be a ſurfeit: and ſome men take cold with leaving off a half ſhirt, who at another time might leave off half their clothes. The indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is within: and if men did not love to be tempted, it would not prevaile at all. Wine is no temptation to an abſtemious man, nor all the
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:115796:283"/>beauties of <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> the Devil could not prevail with ſuch trifles; but half ſuch an offer would overthrow all the trifling purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the effeminate. To ſay that ſuch a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is great, is to ſay, that you love the ſin too well to which you are tempted. For temptations prevail onely by our paſſions and our appetites: leave to love the ſin, and the temptation is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; but if you love it, then complain of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but thy ſelf, for thou makeſt the temptation great, by being in love with life and ſin, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring vanity before eternul pleaſures. In the Apophthegms of the <hi>Egyptian Anachorets,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bibl. PP. tom. 9. p. 286.</note> I read of one who had an apparition in the likeneſs of Chriſt. A vain and a proud perſon would have hugg'd himſelf, and entertain'd the illuſion. But he ſhutting his eyes, ſaid, <hi>I ſhall ſee Chriſt in heaven, it is enough for me to hope and to believe while I am on earth.</hi> This or the like did and did not prevail by our weakneſſes, not by their own ſtrength: and to pretend the ſtrength of a temptation, is to ſay, we are to be excuſed, becauſe we love ſin too well, and are too much delighted with baſer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and we cannot help it, becauſe we love to die.</p>

<pb n="513" facs="tcp:115796:283"/>ſins directly againſt him. The will hath no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, but what God and her ſelf impoſes; for it can chooſe in deſpight of all arguments and notices from the underſtanding. For if it can deſpiſe an argument from reaſon, it can alſo deſpiſe an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſenſe; if it can refuſe a good argument, it can alſo refuſe a fooliſh one: if it can chooſe and not yeeld to religion, it can alſo chooſe and not yeeld to intereſt. If it can reject profit, it can reject pleaſure; if it can refuſe every argument, it can refuſe all, and will becauſe it will; it can as well be malicious as doe unreaſonably: and there could be no ſin at all, if the will never did amiſs but when it were deceived: and even when the will chooſes pleaſure before heaven, it is not becauſe that ſeems better, but becauſe it will chooſe againſt all reaſon, onely upon its own account. For it is certain, he that chooſes any thing upon that which he knows is but a ſeeming and a fallacious reaſon, may if he pleaſe doe it without all reaſon: and ſo the will can doe, againſt reaſon, in deſpight of powers, and hopes, and intereſt, and threatning. * And therefore whatſoever is voluntarily cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, let it be taken care of, that it be good; for if it be not, there can no excuſe come from thence.</p>

<pb n="522" facs="tcp:115796:288"/>hath the leaſt reaſon to pretend infirmity for his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, becauſe he hath the ſtrengths of the Spirit, and did maſter ſin in its ſtrengths, and in deſpight of all its vigorouſneſs and habit; and therefore certainly can doe ſo much rather when ſin is weak and grace is ſtrong. The reſult of which conſideration is this, that no man ſhould pleaſe himſelf in his ſin, becauſe it is a ſin of infirmity. He that is pleaſed with it, becauſe he thinks it is indulg'd to him, ſins with pleaſure, and therefore not of <hi>infirmity; for that is ever againſt our will, and beſides our obſervation.</hi> No ſin is a ſin of infirmity unleſs we have it, and ſtrive againſt it. <hi>He that hath gotten ſome ſtrength may pretend ſome infirmity. But he that hath none is dead.</hi>

                  <p n="13">13. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="76"/> Let no man think that the proper evil of his age or ſtate, or of his Nation is in the latitude and nature of it, a ſin of a pardonable infirmity. The luſts of youth, and the covetouſneſs or pride of old age, and the peeviſhneſs of the afflicted, are ſtates of evil, not ſins of infirmity. For it is highly conſiderable, that ſins of infirmity are but ſingle ones. There is no ſuch thing as a ſtate of a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able infirmity. If by diſtemper of the body, or the vanity of years, or the evil cuſtomes of a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a vice does creep upon, and ſeiſe on the man, it is that againſt which the man ought to watch and pray, and labour; it is a ſtate of danger and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. But that muſt not be called infirmity which corrupts Nations and ſtates of life, but that onely, which in ſingle inſtances ſurpriſes even a watchful perſon, when his guards are moſt remiſs.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="77"/> Whatſoever ſin comes regularly, or by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, is not to be excuſed upon the pretence of infirmity; but is the indication of an evil habit. Therefore never admit a ſin upon hopes of excuſe; for it is certain, no evil that a man chooſes is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:115796:288"/>cuſable. No man ſins with a pardon about his neck. But if the ſin comes at <hi>a certain time,</hi> it comes from <hi>a certain cauſe;</hi> and then it cannot be <hi>infirmity:</hi> for all <hi>ſins of infirmity, are ſins of chance, irregular, and accidental.</hi>

                  <p n="15">15. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> Be curious to avoid all proverbs and propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, or odde ſayings, by which evil life is incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and the hands of the ſpirit weakned. It is ſtrange to conſider what a prejudice to a mans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of things is a contrary proverb. <hi>Can any good thing come out of Galilee?</hi> And <hi>when Chriſt cometh, no man knoweth whence he is.</hi> Two or three proverbs, did in deſpight of all the miracles, and holy doctrines, and rare example of Chriſt hinder many of the Jews from beleeving in him. The words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> miſunderſtood, and worſe applied, have been ſo often abuſed to evil purpoſes, that they have almoſt paſſed into a proverbial excuſe, <hi>The evil that I would not that I doe.</hi> Such ſayings as theſe, are to be tried by the ſevereſt meaſures, and all ſuch ſenſes of them which are enemies to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life are to be rejected, becauſe they are againſt the whole Oeconomy and deſign of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, of the life and death of Chriſt. But a proverb being uſed by every man, is ſuppoſed to contain the opinion and belief, or experience of mankinde: and then that evil ſenſe that we are pleaſed to put to them, will be thought to be of the ſame authority. I have heard of divers perſons who have been ſtrangely intic'd on to finiſh their revellings, and drunken conventicles by a catch, or a piece of a ſong, by a humor, and a word, by a bold ſaying, or a common proverb: and whoever take any meaſures of good evil, but the ſevereſt diſcourſes of reaſon and religion, will be like a ſhip turned every way by a little piece of wood; by chance, and by half a ſentence, becauſe they dwell upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:115796:289"/>and a wave of the Sea is their foundation.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="79"/> Let every man take heed of a ſervile will, and a commanding luſt: for he that is ſo miſerable is in a ſtate of infirmity and death; and will have a perpetual need of ſomething to hide his folly, or to excuſe it, but ſhall finde nothing.

Thus when S. <hi>Stephen</hi> pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his perſecutors, and our bleſſed Lord himſelf on his uneaſie death-bed of the Croſs, prayed for them that Crucified him, it can onely prove, that theſe great ſins are pardonable in our firſt acceſs to Chriſt, becauſe they for whom Chriſt and his Martyr S. <hi>Stephen</hi> prayed, were not yet converted, and ſo were to be ſaved by <hi>Baptiſmal Repentance.</hi> Then the Power of the Keyes is exerciſed, and the gates of the Kingdome are opened, then we
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:115796:293"/>enter into the Covenant of mercy and pardon, and promiſe faith and perpetual obedience to the laws of Jeſus; and upon that condition, forgiveneſs is promiſed and exhibited, offer'd and conſign'd, <hi>but never after:</hi> for it is in Chriſtianity for all great ſins, as in the Civil law for theft.

                  <p>This opinion of theirs,

                     <hi>Non debe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus ſuperbi eſſe, neque reprehendere veteres, ne fortè poſt agnitionem Dei agentes aliquid quod non placet Deo, remiſſionem non habeamus ultrà delictorum, &amp; excludamur à regno ejus.</hi>

                  <p>This opinion and the conſequent practice,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> had its fate in ſeveral places to live longer or die ſooner. And in <hi>Africa</hi> the decree of <hi>Zephyrinus</hi> for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of penitent adulterers, was not admitted

For there was then no thought of any neceſſity that other Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches ſhould obey the ſanctions of the Pope, or the decrees of <hi>Rome,</hi> but they retain'd the old Diſcipline. But yet the piety and the reaſonableneſs of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of <hi>Zephyrinus</hi> prevail'd by little and little, and <hi>adulterers</hi> were admitted; but the ſeverity ſtuck lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger upon <hi>diolaters</hi> or <hi>apoſtates:</hi> for they were not to be admitted to the peace of the Church, although they ſhould afterwards ſuffer martyrdome for the name of Chriſt: and for this they pretended the words of S.

                  </p>
                  <p>This was ſevere,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> if we judge of it by the manners and propoſitions of the preſent age. But iniquity did ſo abound, and was ſo far from being cured by this ſevere diſcipline, that it made this diſcipline to be intolerable and uſeleſs. And therefore even from this alſo they did quickly retire. For in the time of <hi>Innocentius</hi> and S.
<note place="margin">Innocent. epiſt. ad Exuper.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> they began not onely to impoſe penances on dying penitents, but even after a wicked life to reconcile them. They then firſt began to doe it; but as it uſually happens in firſt attempts, and inſolent actions, they were fearful, and knew not the event, and would warrant nothing. <hi>To hinder them that are in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of death from the uſe of the laſt remedy, is hard and impious; but to promiſe any thing in ſo late a cure is temerarious.</hi> So <hi>Salvian:</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> to <hi>Theodorus</hi> would not have ſuch perſons deſpaired, ſo

                     <note place="margin">Salvian.</note> to try every way, rather then that the dying penitent ſhould fail for want of help.

                  </p>
                  <p>This was the moſt dangerous indulgence,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of doctrine, that had as yet entred into the Church; but now it was tumbling, and therefore could not ſtop here, but preſently, down went all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity. <hi>All ſinners,</hi> and <hi>at all times,</hi> and <hi>as often as they would,</hi> might be admitted to repentance and pardon; whether they could or could not perform the ſtations and injunctions of the penitents; and this took off the edge of publick and Eccleſiaſtical repentance; and to this ſucceeded <hi>private repentance,</hi> where none but God and the Prieſt were witneſſes; and becauſe this was a receſſion from the old diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and of it ſelf an abuſe, or but the relicks of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline at the beſt, and therefore not neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was but an imperfect ſupply of ſomething that was better, this alſo is in ſome places laid aſide, in others too much abus'd.

                  <p>But now that I may give an account concerning the firſt ſeverity:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> Concerning their not admitting thoſe three ſorts of Criminals to repentance, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying it to none elſe, I conſider, 1. That there is no place of Scripture that was pretended to exclude thoſe three Capital ſins from hopes of pardon. For one of them there was, of which I ſhall give account in the following periods
<note n="*" place="margin">§. 4.</note>: but for <hi>murder</hi> and <hi>adultery</hi> there were very many authorities of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to prove them pardonable, but none to prove them unpardonable. 2.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> what real effect this had upon the perſons or ſouls of the offending, relapſing perſons; the conſideration is weighty and material. For to ſay the Church could not abſolve ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in plain ſpeaking ſeems to mean, that ſince the Church miniſters nothing of her own, but is the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Divine mercy, ſhe had no commiſſion to promiſe pardon to ſuch perſons. If God had promiſed pardon to ſuch Criminals, it is certain the Church was bound to preach it; but if ſhe could not declare, preach, or exhibite any ſuch promiſe, then there was no ſuch promiſe; and therefore their ſending them to God was but a put off, or a civil an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, ſaying, that God might doe it if he pleaſe, but he had not ſignified his pleaſure concerning them, and whether they who ſinn'd ſo foully after Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, were pardonable, was no where revealed; and therefore all the Miniſters of Religion were bound to ſay, they were unpardonable, that is, God never ſaid he would pardon them, which is the full ſenſe of the word <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npardonable.</hi> For he that ſayes, any ſin is <hi>unpardonable,</hi> does not mean that God cannot pardon it, but that he will not, or that he hath not ſaid, he will.</p>

And indeed the caſe was hard, when it ſhould be remembred that whatſoever the Church did binde on earth was bound in heaven, and if they retain'd them below, God would doe ſo above; and therefore we finde in Scripture that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to <hi>give repentance,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purpoſe of Chriſts coming and the grace of the Goſpel, does mean, to give the effect of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that is, pardon. And ſince Gods method is ſuch, by giving the grace, and admitting us to doe the duty, he conſequently brings to that mercy which is the end of that duty, it is fit, that ſhould alſo be the method of the Church.</p>
                  <p>For the ballancing of this Conſideration,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> we are further to conſider, that though the Church had power to pardon in all things where God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd he would, yet becauſe in ſome ſins the malice was ſo great, the ſcandal ſo intolerable, the effect ſo miſchievous, the nature of them ſo contradictory to the excellent laws of Chriſtianity, the Church many times could not give a competent judgement, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any man that had committed great ſins, had made his amends, and done a ſufficient penance: and the Church not knowing whether their Repentance was worthy and acceptable to God, ſhe could not pronounce their pardon, that is, ſhe could not tell them whether upon thoſe terms God had, or would pardon them in the preſent diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>For after great crimes,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> the ſtate of a ſinner is very deplorable by reaſon of his uncertain pardon; not that it is uncertain whether God will pardon the truly penitent, but that it is uncertain who is ſo; and all the ingredients into the judgement that is to be made, are ſuch things which men cannot well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, they cannot tell in what meaſures God will
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:115796:300"/>exact the Repentance, what ſorrow is ſufficient, what fruits acceptable, what is expiatory, and what reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
<note place="margin">Pro. 20.9.</note> according to the ſaying of <hi>Solomon, Who can ſay, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my ſin?</hi> they cannot tell how long God will forbear, at what time his anger is final, and when he will refuſe to hear, or what aggravations of the crime God looks on; nor can they make an eſtimate which is greater, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the ſin, or the example of the puniſhment. And therefore in ſuch great caſes the Church had reaſon to refuſe to give pardon, which ſhe could mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter neither certainly, nor prudently, nor (as the caſe then ſtood) ſafely or piouſly.</p>
                  <p>But yet ſhe enjoyn'd Penances,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> that is, all the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnities of Repentance, and to them the ſinners ſtood bound in earth, and conſequently in heaven (according to the words of our bleſſed Saviour) but ſhe bound them no further. She intended charity and relief to them, not ruine and death eternal. On this ſhe had no direct power, and if the penitents were obedient to her Diſcipline, then neither could they be prejudic'd by her indirect power, ſhe ſent them to God for pardon, and made them to prepare themſelves accordingly. Her injunction of penances was medicinal, and her refuſing to admit them to the Communion, was an act of caution fitted to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent neceſſities of the Church.

                  <p>For the pardon of ſins committed after Baptiſm,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> not being deſcribed in full meaſures; and though it be ſufficiently ſignifi'd that any ſin may be pardon'd, yet it not being told upon what conditions this or that great one ſhall, the Church did well and warily not to be too forward: for as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious to my ſelf in nothing, yet I am not hereby juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> ſo we may ſay in Repentance, <hi>I have repented, and doe ſo, but I am not hereby juſtified;</hi> becauſe that is a ſecret which until the day of Judgement we ſhall not underſtand: for every repenting is not ſufficient. He that repents worthily (let his ſin be what it will) ſhall certainly be pardon'd; but after great crimes who does repent worthily, is a matter of harder judgement then the manners of the preſent age will allow us to make; and ſo ſecret, that they thought it not amiſs very often to be backward in pronouncing the Criminal abſolved.</p>
                  <p>But then all this whole affair muſt needs be a mighty arreſt to the gayeties of this ſinful age.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> For although Chriſts blood can expiate all ſins, and his
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:115796:301"/>Spirit can ſanctifie all ſinners, and his Church can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore all that are capable; yet if we conſider that the particulars of every naughty mans caſe are infinitely uncertain; that there are no minute-meaſures of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſet down after Baptiſm, that there are ſome ſtates of ſinners which God does reject; that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival to this ſtate is by parts, and undetermin'd ſteps of progreſſion; that no man can tell when any ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be unpardonable to ſuch a perſon; and that if we be careleſs of our ſelves, and eaſie in our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and comply with the falſe meaſures of any age, we may be in before we are aware, and cannot come out ſo ſoon as we expect; and laſtly, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that the Primitive and Apoſtolical Churches, who beſt knew how to eſtimate the mercies of the Goſpel, and the requiſites of repentance, and the malignity and dangers of ſin, did not promiſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſo eaſily, ſo readily, ſo quickly as we doe, we may think it fit to be more afraid and more contrite, more watchful and more ſevere.</p>

                  <p>In ſmaller offences,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> and the ſeldome returns of ſin intervening in a good or a probable life, the Curates of ſouls may make ſafe and prudent judgements.

<pb n="554" facs="tcp:115796:304"/>onely relative to the perſon. It is impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore him, whoſe ſtate of evil is contrary to pardon and reſtitution, as being a renouncing the Goſpel, that is the whole Covenant of pardon and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.

The Phariſees ſaw the light of Gods Spirit manifeſtly ſhining in the miracles which Chriſt did, and they did not onely deſpiſe his Perſon and perſecute it, which is <hi>ſpeaking againſt the Son of Man,</hi> that is, ſinning againſt him (for <hi>ſpeaking againſt,</hi> is <hi>ſinning</hi> or <hi>doing againſt</hi> it, in the Jews manner of expreſſion) but they alſo ſpightfully and maliciouſly blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that Spirit, and that power of God, by which they were convinc'd, and by which ſuch Miracles were done.

                  <p>Now this was ever eſteemed a high and an into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Crime;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="43"/> for it was not new, but an old Crime; onely it was manifeſted by an appellative relating to a power and a name now more uſed then formerly. This was the ſin for which <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company died, who did deſpiſe and reproach the works of God, his power and the mightineſs of his hand manifeſted in his ſervant <hi>Moſes.</hi> It is called <hi>ſinning with a high hand,</hi> that is, with an hand lift up on high againſt God. <hi>Corah</hi> and his Company committed the ſin againſt the Holy Spirit, for they ſpake againſt that Spirit and power, which God had
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:115796:305"/>put into <hi>Moſes,</hi> and prov'd by the demonſtration of mighty effects: It is a denying that great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Credibility, by which God goes about to verifie any miſſion of his, to prove by mighty effects of Gods Spirit, that God hath ſent ſuch a man. When God manifeſts his holy Spirit by ſigns and wonders extraordinary, not to revere this good Spirit, not to confeſs him, but to revile him, or to reproach the power, is that which God ever did highly puniſh.</p>
                  <p>Thus it happened to <hi>Pharoah;</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="44"/> he alſo ſinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt, the good Spirit of God: for when his Magicians told him that the finger of God was there, yet he hardned his heart againſt it, and then God went on to harden it more till he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw him; for then his ſin became unpardonable in the ſenſe I ſhall hereafter explicate. And this paſs'd into a law to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and they were warned of it with the higheſt threatning, that is, of a capital puniſhment <hi>[The ſoul that doeth ought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly</hi> (or with an high hand) <hi>the ſame reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth the Lord,

                  <p>Now this ſin muſt in all reaſon be very much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under the Goſpel then under the Law.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> For when Chriſt came he did ſuch miracles which never any man did, and preach'd a better law, and with mighty demonſtrations of the Spirit, that is, of the power and Spirit of God, prov'd himſelf to have come from God, and therefore men were more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd; and he that was ſo, and yet would oppoſe the Spirit, that is, defie all his proofs, and hear none of his words, and obey none of his laws, and at laſt revile him too, he had done the great ſin; for
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:115796:306"/>this is to doe the worſt thing we can, we diſhonour God in that in which he intended moſt to glorifie himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Two inſtances of this we finde in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> though not of the higheſt degree, yet becauſe done directly againſt the Spirit of God, that is, in deſpite or in diſparagement of that Spirit by which ſo great things were wrought, it grew intolerable. <hi>Ananias</hi> did not revere the Spirit of God, ſo migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily appearing in S. <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles, and he was ſmitten and died. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> took the Spirit of God for a vendible commodity, for a thing leſs then money, and fit to ſerve ſecular ends; and he inſtantly fell into the gall of bitterneſs, that is, a ſad bitter calamity: and S. <hi>Peter</hi> knew not whether God would forgive him or no.</p>
                  <p>But it is remarkable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> that the holy Scriptures note various degrees of this malignity; <hi>grieving the holy Spirit, reſiſting</hi> him, <hi>quenching</hi> him, <hi>doing deſpite</hi> to him: all ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but yet they that had done ſo, were all called to repentance. S. <hi>Stephens</hi> Sermon was an inſtance of it, and ſo was S. <hi>Peters,</hi> and ſo was the prayer of Chriſt upon the Croſs, for the malicious Jews, the Phariſees, <hi>his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayers and murtherers.</hi> But the ſin it ſelf is of an indefinite progreſſion, and hath not phyſical limits and a certain conſtitution, as is obſervable in carnal crimes, Theft, Murther, or Adultery: for though even theſe are increaſed by circumſtances, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward conſent and degrees of love and adheſion; yet of the crime it ſelf we can ſay, this is Murther, and this is Adultery, and therefore the puniſhment is proper and certain. But ſince there are ſo many degrees of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not in an indiviſible point, but according to the nature of internal and ſpiritual ſins, it is like time or numbers, of a moveable being, of a flux, unſtable,
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:115796:306"/>immenſe conſtitution, and may be alwayes growing, not onely by the repetition of acts, but by its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per eſſential increment; and ſince in the particular caſe the meaſures are uncertain, the nature ſecret, the definition diſputable, and ſo many ſins are like it, or reducible to it, apt to produce deſpair in timorous conſciences, and to diſcourage Repentance in lapſed perſons, it will be an intolerable propoſition that affirms the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt to be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unpardonable.</p>
                  <p>That the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt is pardonable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> appears in the inſtance of the Phariſees; to whom, even after they had committed the ſin, God was pleaſed to afford preaching, ſigns and miracles, and Chriſt upon the Croſs prayed for them; but in what ſenſe alſo it was unpardonable, appears in their caſe; for they were ſo far gone, that they would not return, and God did not, and at laſt would not pardon them. For this appellative is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſubjected, nor attributed to the ſin it ſelf, but it is according as the man is. The ſin may be, and is at ſome time unpardonable, yet not in all its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and parts of progreſſion; as appears in the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who all the way from the firſt miracle to the tenth, ſinn'd againſt the Holy Ghoſt, but at laſt he was ſo bad, that God would not pardon him. Some men are come to the greatneſs of the ſin, or to that ſtate and grandeur of impiety, that their eſtate is deſperate, that is, though the nature of their ſins is ſuch as God is extremely angry with them, and would deſtroy them utterly, were he not reſtrain'd by an infinite mercy, yet it ſhall not be thus for ever; for in ſome ſtate of circumſtances and degrees, God is finally angry with the man, and will never return to him.</p>
                  <p>Untill things be come to this height,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> whatſoever the ſin be it is pardonable. For if there were any
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:115796:307"/>one ſin diſtinguiſhable in its whole nature and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from others, which in every of its periods were unpardonable, it is moſt certain it would have been deſcribed in Scripture with clear characters and cautions, that a man might know when he is in and when he is out. <hi>Speaking a word againſt the Holy Spirit</hi> is by our bleſſed Saviour called this great ſin; but it is certain, that every word ſpoken againſt him is not unpardonable. <hi>Simon Magus</hi> ſpoke a foul word againſt him, but S. <hi>Peter</hi> did not ſay it was unpardonable, but when he bid him pray, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently bid him hope; but becauſe he would not warrant him, that is, durſt not abſolve him, he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declared that this ſin is of an indefinite na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and by growth would arrive at the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſtate; the ſtate and fulneſs of it is unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that is, God will to ſome men, and in ſome times and ſtages of their evil life, be ſo angry, that he will give them over, and leave them, in their reprobate minde. But no man knowes when that time is, God only knowes, and the event muſt declare it.</p>
                  <p>But for the thing it ſelf,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> that it is <hi>pardonable,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certain, becauſe it may be pardoned in baptiſme: The <hi>Novatians</hi> denied not to baptiſme a power of pardoning any ſin; &amp; in this ſenſe it is without doubt true what <hi>Zoſimus</hi> by way of reproach objected to Chriſtian religion, it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Now whereas our B.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="51"/> Lord affirmed of this ſin it ſhall not be pardoned in this world nor in the world to come; we may beſt underſtand the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:115796:307"/>of it by the parallel words of old <hi>Heli</hi> to his ſons: <hi>If a man ſin againſt another,
<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2, 25.</note> the Judge ſhall judge him, placari ei poteſt Deus,</hi> ſo the vulgar latine reads it, God may be appeaſed, that is, <hi>it ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given him;</hi> that is a word ſpoken againſt the Son of man, which relates to Chriſt only upon the account of his humane nature, that may be forgiven him, it ſhall, that is, upon eaſier terms, as upon a temporal judgment, called in this place, <hi>a being judged by the Judge. But if a man ſin againſt the Lord who ſhall intreat for him?</hi> that is, <hi>if he ſin with a high hand, preſumptuouſly,</hi> againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> againſt his <hi>power,</hi> and <hi>his Spirit, who ſhall intreat for him? it ſhall never be pardoned;</hi> never ſo as the other, never upon a temporal judgement: that cannot expiate this great ſin, as it could take off a ſin againſt a man, or the Son of man: for though it be puniſhed here, it ſhall be puniſhed hereafter. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> 
                     <hi>It ſhall not be pardoned in this world, nor in the world to come]</hi> that is, neither to the Jewes, nor to the Gentiles. For <hi>Saeculum hoc, this World,</hi> in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the period of the Jewes Synagogue, and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>the world to come</hi> is taken for the Goſpel, or the age of the Meſſias frequently among the Jews: and it is not unlikely Chriſt might mean it in that ſenſe which was uſed amongſt them by whom he would be underſtood: But becauſe the word was alſo as commonly uſed in that ſenſe in which it is underſtood at this day, <hi>viz.</hi> for the world after this life; I ſhall therefore propound another expoſition which ſeems to me more probable. Though remiſſion of ſins is more plentiful in the Goſpel then under the Law, yet becauſe the ſin is bigger under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, there is not here any ordinary way of pardoning it, no Miniſtery eſtabliſhed to warrant or abſolve ſuch ſinners, but it muſt be referred to God himſelf; and yet that's not all. For if a man perſeveres in this
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:115796:308"/>ſin, he ſhall neither be forgiven <hi>here,</hi> nor <hi>hereafter;</hi> that is, neither can he be abſolved in this world by the miniſtery of the Church, nor in the world to come by the ſentence of Chriſt: and this I take to be the full meaning of this ſo difficult place.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>in this world</hi> properly ſo ſpeaking,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> there is no forgiveneſſe of ſins but what is by the miniſtery of the Church. For then a ſin is forgiven when it is pardon'd in the day of ſentence, or execution; that is, when thoſe evils are removed w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are uſually inflicted, or which are proper to that day. Now then for the final puniſhment, that is not till the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and if God then gives us a <hi>mercy in that day,</hi> then is the day of our pardon from him; In the mean time if he be gracious to us here, he either forbears to ſmite us, or ſmites us to bring us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and all the way continues to us the uſe of the Word and Sacraments; that is, if he does in any ſenſe pardon us here, if he does not give us over to a <hi>reprobate minde,</hi> he continues us under the means of ſalvation, which is the miniſtery of the Church, for that's the way of pardon <hi>in this

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/> So that when our great Lord and Maſter threatens to this ſin, <hi>it ſhall not be pardon'd in this World, nor in the World to come,</hi> he means that neither ſhall the Miniſters of the Church pronounce his pardon, or comfort his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, or reſtore him after his fall, or warrant his condition, or pray for him publickly, or give him the peace and communion of the Church: neither will God pardon him in the day of Judgement.</p>
                  <p>But all this fearful denunciation of the Divine judgement is only upon ſuppoſition the man does not repent.

<pb n="564" facs="tcp:115796:309"/>pardoned: So that to ſay it is <hi>unpardonable</hi> without repentance, is to ſay nothing peculiar of this.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> that <hi>pardonable</hi> and <hi>unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> have no definite ſignification, but have a lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and increment, and a various ſenſe; but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſignifie in the abſolute ſupreme ſenſe ſins of infirmity; ſuch, I mean, which in any ſenſe can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called ſins, muſt in ſome ſenſe or other be repented of; and they are unpardonable without repentance, that is, without ſuch a repentance as does diſallow them and contend againſt them. But theſe are alſo pardonable <hi>without repentance,</hi> by ſome degrees of <hi>pardon,</hi> that is, God pities our ſins of ignorance and winks at them, and upon the only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his own pity does bring ſuch perſons to better notices of things. And they are pardonable <hi>without repentance,</hi> if by <hi>repentance</hi> we mean an <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dereliction</hi> of them, for we ſhall never be able to leave them quite; and therefore either they ſhall never be pardoned, or elſe they are pardoned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch a repentance as ſignifies dereliction or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire maſtery over them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/> But ſins which are wilfully and knowingly committed, as <hi>theft, adultery, murder,</hi> are unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able without repentance, that is, without ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance as forſakes them actually and intirely, and produces ſuch acts of grace as are proper for their expiation: but yet even theſe ſins require not ſuch a repentance as ſins againſt the holy Ghoſt do: Theſe muſt have a greater ſorrow, and a greater ſhame, and a more ſevere amends, and a more paſſionate laſting prayer and a bigger fear, and a more publick amends, and a ſharper infliction, &amp; greater excellency of grace then is neceſſary in leſſer ſins. But in this difference of ſins it is uſual to promiſe pardon to the leſs and not to the greater, when the meaning is, that the ſmaller
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:115796:309"/>ſins are onely pardon'd upon eaſier terms: an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this we have in <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi>

So we ſay concerning thoſe ſins which we have forgotten, they may be pardon'd <hi>without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> meaning <hi>without a ſpecial repentance,</hi> but yet not without a <hi>general.</hi> Thus we finde it in the Imperial Law, that they that had fallen into hereſie or ſtrange ſuperſtitions, they were to be pardon'd if they did repent: but if they did relapſe, they ſhould not be pardon'd; but they mean,

So that by denying par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, they onely mean that it ſhall be harder with ſuch perſons, their pardon ſhall not be ſo eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, but as they repeat their ſins, ſo their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhall increaſe, and at laſt if no warning will ſerve, it ſhall deſtroy them.</p>
                  <p>For it is remarkable,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> that in Scripture <hi>Pardonable</hi> and <hi>

Some ſins are like deadly potions, they kill the man, unleſs he ſpeedily take an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote, or unleſs by ſtrength of nature he work out the poiſon and overcome it; and others are like a deſperate diſeaſe, or a deadly wound, the Iliacal paſſions, the Phyſicians give him over, it is a <hi>Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere mei Deus;</hi> of which though men deſpair, yet ſome have been cured.

And this is the caſe of too many miſerable perſons. They who repent timely, and holily, are not in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, whatſoever ſins they be which they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:115796:310"/>But this is the caſe of them whom God hath given over to a reprobate minde, and of them who ſin againſt Gods holy Spirit, when their ſin is grown to its full meaſure: So we finde it expreſs'd in the Proverbs, <hi>Turn ye at my reproof,
<note place="margin">Pro. 1.23, 26, 28.</note> I will pour out my Spirit unto you;</hi> and then it follows, <hi>Becauſe I have called and ye refuſed, I alſo will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh.</hi> But this is not in all the periods of our refuſing to hear God calling by his Spirit; but when the ſin of the <hi>Amalekites</hi> is full, then it is unpardonable, not in the thing, but to that man, at that time. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all the promiſes, this is highly verified in the words of our bleſſed Saviour taken out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> where it is affirmed, that when people are ſo obſtinate and wilfully blinde,
<note place="margin">Mat. 12.15.</note> that God then leaves to give them clearer teſtimony and a mighty grace, leſt they ſhould hear and ſee and underſtand; it follows, <hi>and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them;</hi> plainly telling us, that if even then they ſhould repent, God could not but forgive them; and therefore becauſe he hath now no love left to them by reaſon of their former obſtinacy, yet where ever you can ſuppoſe Repentance, there you may more then ſuppoſe a pardon. But if a man cannot, or will not repent, then it is another conſideration: In the mean time, nothing hinders but that every ſin is pardonable to him that repents.</p>

Our firſt faults are pitiable, and we doe <hi>pati humanum,</hi> we do after the manner of men; but when we are recovered, and then die again, we doe <hi>facere Diabolicum,</hi> we do after the manner of Devils. For from ignorance to ſin, from paſſion and youthful appetites to ſin, from violent temptations and little ſtrengths, to fall into ſin, is no very great change; it is from a corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted nature to corrupted manners: But from grace to return to ſin, from knowledge and experience, and delight in goodneſſe and wiſe notices, from God
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:115796:312"/>and his Chriſt to return to ſin, to fooliſh actions, and non-ſenſe principles, is a change great as was the fall of the morning ſtars when they deſcended cheaply and fooliſhly into darkneſs; Well therefore may it be pitied in a childe to chooſe a bright dagger before a warm coat, but when he hath been refreſhed by this and ſmarted by that, if he chooſes again, he will chooſe better. But men that have tried both ſtates, that have rejoyced for their deliverance from temptation, men that have given thanks to God for their ſafety and innocence, men that have been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and aſhamed of the follies of ſin, that have weighed both ſides and have given wiſe ſentence for God and for religion, if they ſhall chooſe again, and chooſe amiſs, it muſt be by ſomething by which <hi>Lucifer</hi> did in the face of God chooſe to defie him, and deſire to turn Devil, and be miſerable and wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for ever and ever.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> If a man repents of his repentances and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his ſins, all his intermedial repentance ſhall ſtand for nothing: the ſins which were marked for pardon ſhall break out in guilt, and be exacted of him in fearful puniſhments, as if he never had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented. For if good works crucified by ſins are made alive by repentance, by the ſame reaſon, thoſe ſins alſo will live again, if the repentance dies; it being equally juſt that if the man repents of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, God alſo ſhould repent of his pardon.</p>
                  <p>For we muſt obſerve carefully that there is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſins proper to this life,

Here in proper ſpeaking our pardon is but a diſpoſition towards the great and final pardon; a poſſibility and ability to purſue that intereſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for that abſolution: and accordingly it is wrought by parts, and is ſignified and promoted by every act of grace that puts us in order to heaven, or the ſtate of final pardon: God gives us one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of pardon when he forbears to kill us in the act of ſin, when he admits, when he calls, when he ſmites us into repentance, when he invites us by mercies and promiſes, when he abates or defers his anger, when he ſweetly engages us in the wayes of holineſs, theſe are ſeveral parts and ſteps of pardon: For if God were extremely angry with us as we deſerve, nothing of all this would be done unto us: and ſtill Gods favours increaſe, and the degrees of pardon multiply, as our endevours are proſperous, as we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to religion and holineſs, and make uſe of the benefits of the Church, the miniſtery of the Word and Sacraments, and as our reſolutions paſſe into acts and habits of vertue. But then in this world we are to expect no other pardon, but a fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, alterable, uncertain pardon, as our duty is uncertain. Hereafter it ſhall be finiſhed, if here we perſevere in the parts and progreſſions of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: But as yet it is an Embryo, in a ſtate of conduct and imperfection; here we alwayes pray for it, alwayes hope it, alwayes labour for it; but we are not fully and finally abſolved till the day of ſentence and judgement; untill that day we hope and labour. * The purpoſe of this diſcourſe is to repreſent in what ſtate of things our pardon ſtands here; and that it is not only conditional, but of it
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:115796:313"/>ſelf and a mutable effect, a diſpoſition towards the great pardon, and therefore if it be not nurs'd and maintain'd by the proper inſtruments of its progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it dies like an abortive conception, and ſhall not have that immortality whether it was deſigned.</p>

Indeed in the Church of <hi>England</hi> I cannot ſo eaſily blame that proceeding; becauſe there are ſo few that uſe the proper and ſecret miniſtery of a ſpiritual guide, that it is to be ſuppoſed he that does ſo, hath long repented and done ſome violence to himſelf and more to his ſins, before he can maſter himſelf ſo much as to bring himſelf to ſubmit to that miniſtery. But there where the practiſe is common, and the ſhame is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and the duty returnes at certain feſtivals, and is frequently performed, to abſolve as ſoon as the ſinner confeſſes, and leave him to amend afterwards if he pleaſe is to give him confidence and careleſneſs, but not abſolution.

                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="69"/> Do not judge of the pardon of thy ſins by light and trifling ſignifications, but by long, laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and material events. If God continues to call thee to repentance there is hopes that he is ready to pardon thee; and if thou doeſt obey the heavenly calling, and doeſt not defer to begin, nor ſtop in thy courſe, nor retire to thy vain converſation, thou art in the ſure way of pardon, &amp; mayſt alſo finiſh it. But if thou doeſt believe that thy ſins are pardon'd,
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:115796:314"/>remember the words of our Lord concerning <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> much is forgiven her, and ſhe loved much. If thou feareſt thy ſins are not pardon'd, pray the more earneſtly, and mortifie thy ſin with the more ſeverity; and be no more troubled concerning the event of it, but let thy whole care and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations be concerning thy duty. I have read of one that was much afflicted with fear concerning his final ſtate; and not knowing whether he ſhould perſevere in grace, and obtain a glorious pardon at laſt, cried out, <hi>O ſi ſcirem,</hi> &amp;c. Would to God I might but know whether I ſhould perſevere or no! He was anſwered, What wouldeſt thou doe if thou wert ſure? Wouldſt thou be careleſs, or more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious of thy duty? If that knowledge would make thee careleſs, deſire it not; but if it would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy diligence, then what thou wouldeſt doe in caſe thou didſt know, doe that now thou doeſt not know; and whatever thy notice or perſwaſion be, the thing in it ſelf will be more ſecure and thou ſhalt finde it in the end. But if any man is curious of the event, and would fain know of the event of his ſoul, let him reveal the ſtate of his ſoul to a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and a prudent Spiritual Guide; and <hi>he,</hi> when he hath ſearch'd diligently, and obſerv'd him curiouſly, can tell him all that is to be told, and give him all the aſſurance that is to be given, and warrant him, as much as himſelf hath receiv'd a warrant to doe it. Unleſs God be pleaſed to draw the Curtains of his Sanctuary, and open the ſecrets of his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Counſel, there is no other certainty of an actual pardon, but what the Church does miniſter, and what can be prudently derived from our ſelves. For to every ſuch curious perſon, this onely is to be ſaid, Doe you believe the promiſes? That if we confeſs our ſins and forſake them, if we believe and obey, we ſhall be pardoned and ſaved. If ſo, then enquire
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:115796:314"/>whether or no thou doeſt perform the conditions of thy pardon. How ſhall I know? Examine thy ſelf, try thy own ſpirit, and uſe the help of a holy and a wiſe guide. He will teach thee to know thy ſelf. If after all this, thou anſwereſt, that thou canſt not tell whether thy heart be right, and thy duty acceptable; then ſit down and hope the beſt, and work in as much light and hope as thou haſt; but never enquire after the ſecret of God, when thou doeſt not ſo much as know thy ſelf; and how canſt thou hope to eſpy the moſt private Counſels of Heaven, when thou canſt not certainly perceive what is in thy own hand and heart. But if thou canſt know thy ſelf, you need not enquire any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If thy duty be performed, you may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of all that is on Gods part.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> When ever repentance begins, know that from thence-forward the ſinner begins to live; but then never let that repentance die. Doe not at any time ſay, I have repented of ſuch a ſin, and am at peace for that; for a man ought never to be at peace with ſin, nor think that any thing we can doe is too much: Our repentance for ſin is never to be at an end, till faith it ſelf ſhall be no more; for Faith and Repentance are but the ſame Covenant; and ſo long as the juſt does live by faith in the Son of God, ſo long he lives by repentance; for by that faith in him our ſins are pardoned, that is, by becoming his Diſciples we enter into the Covenant of Repentance. And he undervalues his ſin, and overvalues his ſorrow, who at any time fears he ſhall doe too much, or make his pardon too ſecure, and therefore ſets him down and ſayes, Now I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> Let no man ever ſay he hath committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or the unpardonable ſin; for there are but few that doe that, and he can beſt
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:115796:315"/>confute himſelf, if he can but tell that he is ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful for it, and begs for pardon and hopes for it, and deſires to make amends; this man hath already obtained ſome degrees of pardon: and S. <hi>Pauls</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in this caſe alſo is a demonſtration; <hi>If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son,
<note place="margin">Rom. 5.10.</note> much more being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life.</hi> That is, if God to enemies gives the firſt grace, much more will he give the ſecond, if they make uſe of the firſt. For from none to a little is an infinite diſtance; but from a little to a great deal is not ſo much. And therefore ſince God hath given us means of pardon and the grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, we may certainly expect the fruit of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: for it is a greater thing to give repentance to a ſinner, then to give pardon to the penitent. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever repents hath not committed the great ſin, the Unpardonable. For it is long of the man, not of the ſin, that any ſin is unpardonable.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="78"/> Let every man be careful of entring into any great ſtates of ſin, leſt he be unawares guilty of the great offence: Every reſiſting of a holy motion cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us from ſin, every act againſt a clear reaſon or revelation, every confident progreſſion in ſin, every reſolution to commit a ſin in deſpite of conſcience, is an acceſs towards the great ſin or ſtate of evil. Therefore concerning ſuch a man, let others fear ſince he will not, and ſave him with fear, plucking him out of the fire; but when he begins to return, that great fear is over in many degrees; for even in <hi>Moſes</hi> law there were expiations appointed not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for errour, but for preſumptuous ſins.</p>

Thou didſt not pay for them one drop of bloud, nor endure one ſtripe to recover the fallen ſtars, nor give one groan to ſnatch the accurſed ſpirits from their fearful pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; but thou didſt empty all thy veins for me, and gaveſt thy heart to redeem me from innumerable ſins and an intolerable calamity.

And in this ſenſe S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> means it, ſaying, <hi>Bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance;</hi> that is, ſince now the great expectation of the world is to be ſatisfied, and the Lords Chriſt will open the gates of mercy, and give Repentance to the world, ſee that ye live accordingly, in the faith and obedience of God through Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:115796:317"/>That did in the event of things prove to be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that Sermon.</p>
                  <p>But although all the parts of holy life are <hi>fruits of Repentance,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> when it is taken for <hi>the ſtate of favor publiſhed by the Goſpel;</hi> yet when <hi>Repentance</hi> is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular duty or vertue, the integral parts of holy life, are alſo <hi>conſtituent parts of Repentance;</hi> and then by <hi>the fruits of Repentance</hi> muſt be meant, the leſs neceſſary, but very uſeful effects and miniſteries of <hi>Repentance,</hi> which are ſignifications and exerciſes of the main duty. And theſe are <hi>ſorrow for ſins,</hi> commonly called, <hi>Contrition, Confeſſion</hi> of them, and <hi>Satisfactions;</hi> by which ought to be meant, an oppoſing a contrary act of vertue to the precedent act of ſin, and a puniſhing of our ſelves out of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and indignation for our folly. And this is beſt done by all thoſe acts of Religion by which God is properly appeaſed, and ſin is deſtroyed, that is, by thoſe acts which ſignifie our love to God, and our hatred to ſin, ſuch as are Prayer, and Alms, and forgiving injuries, and puniſhing our ſelves, that is, a forgiving every one but our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Many of theſe (I ſay) are not eſſential parts of Repentance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> without the actual exerciſe of which no man in any caſe can be ſaid to be truly penitent; for the conſtituent parts of Repentance are nothing but the eſſential parts of obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, that is, <hi>direct abſtinence from evil,</hi> and <hi>doing what is in the Precept.</hi> But they are fruits and ſignifications, exerciſes and bleſſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Repentance, uſeful to excellent purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of it, and ſuch from which a man cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, but by great accidents and rare contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. To viſit priſoners, and to redeem captives, and to inſtruct the ignorant, are acts of charity; but he that does not act theſe ſpeciall inſtances, is not alwayes to be condemn'd for want of charity,
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:115796:317"/>becauſe by other acts of grace he may ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and exerciſe his duty: He onely that refuſes any inſtances, becauſe the grace is not operative, he onely is the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncharitable,</hi> but to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars he can be determin'd onely by ſomething from without, but it is ſufficient to the grace it ſelf that it works where it can, or where it is prudently choſen. So it is in theſe fruits of Repentance. He that out of hatred to ſin abſtains from it, and out of love to God endevours to keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he is a true penitent, though he never lie upon the ground, or ſpend whole nights in prayer, or make himſelf ſick with faſting; but he that in all circumſtances refuſes any or all of theſe, and hath not hatred enough againſt his ſin to puniſh it in himſelf, when to doe ſo may accidentally be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or enjoyned, he hath cauſe to ſuſpect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not to be a true penitent.</p>
                  <p>No one of theſe is neceſſary in the ſpecial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

To repent is to leave a ſin; which becauſe it muſt have a cauſe to effect it, can begin no where but where the ſin is for ſome reaſon or other diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, that is, becauſe it does a miſchief. It is enough to leave it, that we know it will ruine us if we abide in it, but that is not enough to make us grieve for it when it is paſt and quitted. For if we believe that as ſoon as ever we repent of it, we ſhall be accepted to pardon, and that infallibly, and that being once forſaken it does not and ſhall not prejudice us, he that conſiders this, and remembers it was pleaſant to him, will ſcarce find cauſe enough to be ſorrowful for it. Neither is it enough to ſay, he muſt grieve for it, or elſe it will do him miſchief. For this is not true for how can ſorrow prevent the miſchief, when the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of it ſelf is not an eſſential duty; or if it were ſo in it ſelf, yet by accident it becomes not to be ſo, for by being unreaſonable and impoſſible, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes alſo not neceſſary, not a duty. To be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful is not always in our power, any more then to be merry; and both of them are the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts of their own objects and of nothing elſe; and then if ſin does us pleaſure at firſt and at laſt no miſchief to the penitent, to bid them be ſorrowful leſt it ſhould do miſchief, is as improper a remedy as if we were commanded to be hungry to prevent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beaten. He that felt nothing but the pleaſure of ſin, and is now told he ſhall feel none of its
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:115796:318"/>evils, and that it can no more hurt him when it is forſaken, then a Bee when the ſting is out, if he be commanded to grieve, may juſtly return in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that as yet he perceives no cauſe.</p>
                  <p>If it be told him,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> it is cauſe enough to grieve that he hath offended God who can puniſh him with ſad, unſufferable, and eternal torments. This is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry true. But if God be not angry with him, and he be told that God will not puniſh him for the ſin he repents of then to grieve for having offended God is ſo Metaphyſical and abſtracted a ſpeculation, that there muſt be ſomething elſe in it, before a ſinner can be tied to it. For to have diſpleaſed God is a great evil, but what is it to me, if it will bring no evil to me; It is a <hi>Metaphyſical</hi> and a <hi>Moral</hi> evil; but unleſſe it be alſo naturally and ſenſibly ſo, it is not the object of a natural and proper grief. It followes therefore that the ſtate of a repenting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt have in it ſome more cauſes of ſorrow then are uſually taught, or elſe in vain can they be called upon to weep and mourn for their ſins. Well may they wring their faces and their hands and put on black, thoſe diſguiſes of paſſion and curtains of joy, thoſe ceremonies and ſhadowes of rich widows, and richer heirs, by which they decently hide their ſecret ſmiles: well may they <hi>rend their garments,</hi> but upon this account they can never <hi>rend their hearts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the ſtating of this article it is conſiderable, that there are ſeveral parts or periods of ſorrow, which are effected by ſeveral principles. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our repentance ſometimes we feel cauſe enough to grieve. For God ſmites many into re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance; either a ſharp ſickneſs does awaken us, or a calamity upon our houſe, or the death of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt relative; and they that finde ſin ſo heavily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, and to preſs their perſons or fortunes with feet of lead, will feel cauſe enough, and need not
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:115796:319"/>to be diſputed into a penitential ſorrow. They feel Gods anger, and the evil effects of ſin, and that it brings ſorrow, and then the ſorrow is juſtly great becauſe we have done that evil which brings ſo ſad a judgement.</p>
                  <p>And in the ſame proportion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> there is always a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> cauſe of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> where there is a <hi>real</hi> cauſe of <hi>fear;</hi> and ſo it is ever in the beginning of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and for ought we know it is for ever ſo, and albeit the cauſes of fear leſſen as the repentance does proceed, yet it will never go quite off, till hope it ſelf be gone and paſſed into charity, or at leaſt into a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, into that fulneſſe of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which is given to few as the reward of a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and conſpicuous holineſſe. And the reaſon is plain. For though it be certain in religion, that whoever repents ſhall be pardoned, yet it is a long time before any man hath repented worthily; and it is as uncertain in what maner and in what meaſures, and in what time God will give us pardon. It is as eaſie to tell the very day in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> a man firſt comes to the uſe of reaſon as to tell the very time in which we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted to final pardon; The progreſſions of one being as diviſible as the other, and leſs diſcernible. For rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon gives many fair indications of it ſelf, whereas God keeps the ſecrets of this mercy in his ſanctuary, and drawes not the curtain till the day of death or judgement.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this that our very repentances have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny allays and imperfections,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> and ſo hath our pardon.</p>
                  <p>And every one that ſins hath ſo diſpleaſed God,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> that he is become the ſubject of the Divine anger. <hi>Death is the wages;</hi> what death God pleaſe, and therefore what <hi>evil</hi> ſoever God will inflict, or his mortality can ſuffer: and he that knowes this, hath cauſe to fear, and he that fears hath cauſe to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that he is fallen from that ſtate of divine favour
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:115796:319"/>in which he ſtood ſecured with the guards of angels, and covered with heaven it ſelfe as with a ſhield, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> he was beloved of God and heir of all his glories.</p>
                  <p>But they that deſcribe repentance in ſhort and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure characters,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> and make repentance and pardon to be the children of a minute, and born and grown up quickly as a fly, or a muſhrome, with the dew of a night, or the tears of a morning, making the labours of the one, and the want of the other to expire ſooner then the pleaſures of a tranſient ſin, are ſo inſenſible of the ſting of ſin that indeed upon their grounds it will be impoſſible to have a real godly ſorrow. For though they have done evil, yet by this doctrine they feel none and there is nothing remains as a cauſe of grief, unleſſe they will be ſorrowful for that they have been pleaſed formerly, and are now ſecured, nothing remains before them or behinde, but the pleaſure that they had and the preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and impunity: and that's no good inſtrument of ſorrow. <hi>Securitas delicti etiam libido eſt ejus.</hi> Sin takes occaſion by the law it ſelf, if there be no penalty annexed.</p>
                  <p>But the firſt inlet of a godly ſorrow which is the beginning of repentance is upon the ſtock of their preſent danger and ſtate of evil into which by their ſin they are fallen,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> 
                     <hi>viz.</hi> when their guilt is manifeſt, they ſee that they are become ſons of death, expos'd to the wrath of a provoked Deity whoſe anger will expreſſe it ſelf when and how it pleaſe, and for ought the man knowes it may be the greateſt, and it may be intolerable: and though his danger is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and certain, yet his pardon is a great way off, it may be Yea, it may be No, it muſt be hop'd for, but it may be miſſed, for it is upon conditions, and they are, or will ſeem very hard.
<q>Sed ut valeas multa à olenda feres:</q>
                     <pb n="586" facs="tcp:115796:320"/>ſo that in the ſumme of affairs, however that the greateſt ſinner and the ſmalleſt penitent, are very apt, and are taught by ſtrange doctrines to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into confidence and preſumption, yet he will have reaſon to mourn and weep, when he ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that he is in ſo ſad a condition, that becauſe his life is uncertain, it is alſo uncertain whether or no he ſhall not be condemned to an eternal priſon of ſlames: ſo that every ſinner hath the ſame reaſon to be ſorrowful, as he hath who from a great ſtate of bleſſings and confidence, is fallen into great fears and great dangers, and a certain guilt and liableneſs of loſing all he hath, and ſuffering all that is inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable. They who ſtate repentance otherwiſe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make it reaſonable that a penitent ſhould ſhed a tear. And therefore it is no wonder, that we ſo eaſily obſerve a great dulneſs and indifferency, ſo many dry eies and merry hearts, in perſons that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend repentance, it cannot more reaſonably be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to any cauſe, then to thoſe trifling and eaſy propoſitions of men, that deſtroy the cauſes of ſorrow, by leſſening and taking off the opinion of danger. But now that they are obſerved and repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, I hope the evil will be leſſened. But to proceed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> Having now ſtated the reaſonableneſs and cauſes of penitential ſorrow; the next inquiry is into the nature and conſtitution of that ſorrow. For it is to be obſerved, that penitential ſorrow is not ſeated in the affections directly, but in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and is rather <hi>Odium</hi> then <hi>Dolor,</hi> it is hatred of ſin, and deteſtation of it, a nolition, a renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and diſclaiming it, whoſe expreſſion is <hi>a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion never to ſin,</hi> and <hi>a purſuance of that reſolution,</hi> by abſtaining from the occaſions, by praying for the Divine aid, by uſing the proper remedies for its mortification. This is eſſential to repentance, and muſt be in every man in the higheſt kinde. For he
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:115796:320"/>that does not hate ſin ſo as rather to chooſe to ſuffer any evil, then to doe any, loves himſelf more then he loves God, becauſe he fears to diſpleaſe himſelf rather then to diſpleaſe him, and therefore is not a true penitent.</p>
                  <p>But although this be not <hi>grief,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> or <hi>ſorrow</hi> proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but <hi>hatred,</hi> yet in <hi>hatred</hi> there is ever a <hi>ſorrow,</hi> if we have done or ſuffered what we hate; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be <hi>ſorrow</hi> or no, is but a ſpeculation of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, but no ingredient of duty. It is that which will deſtroy ſin, and bring us to God, and that is the purpoſe of repentance.</p>
                  <p>For it is remarkable that ſorrow is indeed an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent inſtrument of repentance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> apt to ſet forward many of its miniſteries, and without which men ordinarily will not leave their ſins; but if the thing be done, though wholly upon the diſcourſes of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, upon intuition of the danger, upon contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the unworthineſs of ſin, or onely upon the principle of hope, or fear, it matters not which is the beginning of repentance. For we finde <hi>fear</hi> reckoned to be <hi>the beginning of wiſdome,</hi> that is, of repentance, of wiſe and ſober counſels, by <hi>Solomon.</hi> We finde <hi>ſorrow</hi> to be reckoned as the beginning of repentance by S. <hi>Paul; Godly ſorrow worketh repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance not to be repented of.</hi> So many ways as there are, by which God works repentance in thoſe whom he will bring unto ſalvation, to all the kinds of theſe there are proper apportion'd paſſions: and as in all good things there is pleaſure, ſo in all evil there is pain, ſome way or other: and therefore to <hi>love</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> or which is all one, to <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> all paſſions are reducible, as all <hi>colours</hi> are to <hi>black</hi> and <hi>white.</hi> So that though in all repentances there is not in every perſon felt that ſharpneſs of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive compunction and ſorrow that is uſuall in ſad accidents of the world, yet if the ſorrow be upon
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:115796:321"/>the intellectual account, though it be not much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by inward ſharpneſſes, but chiefly by dereli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and leaving of the ſin, it is that ſorrow which is poſſible, and in our power, and that which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to repentance.</p>
                  <p>For in all inquiries concerning penitential ſorrow,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> if we will avoid ſcruple and vexatious fancies, we muſt be careful not to account of our ſorrow by the meaſures of ſenſe, but of religion. <hi>David</hi> grieved more for the ſickneſs of his child, and the rebellion of his ſon, ſo far as appears in the ſtory: and the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> in behalf of the Jews, for the death of their glorious Prince <hi>Joſiah,</hi> and S. <hi>Paula Romana</hi> at the death of her children, were more paſſionate and ſenſibly afflicted then for their ſins againſt God; that is, they felt more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive trouble in that then this, and yet their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances were not to be reproved; becauſe our penitential ſorrow is from another cauſe, and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in other faculties, and fixed upon differing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and works in other manners, and hath a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſignification, and is fitted to other purpoſes, and therefore is wholly of another nature. It is a diſpleaſure againſt ſin which muſt be expreſſed by praying againſt it, and fighting againſt it; but all other expreſſions are extrinſecal to it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental, and are no parts of it, becauſe they cannot be under a command, as all the parts and neceſſary actions of repentance are moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly.</p>
                  <p>Indeed ſome perſons can command their tears,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> ſo <hi>Gellia</hi> in the Epigram,
<q>Si quis adeſt, juſſae proſiliunt lachrymae;</q> ſhe could cry when company was there to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her weeping for her Father: and ſo can ſome

                     <hi>Orators,</hi> and many <hi>Hypocrites:</hi> and there are ſome that can ſuppreſs their tears by art, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; ſo <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>lyſſes</hi> did when he ſaw his wife weep; he pitied her, but

                     </q> he kept his tears within his eye-lids, as if they had been in a phial, which he could pour forth or keep ſhut at his pleaſure. But although ſome can doe this at pleaſure, yet all cannot. And therefore S. <hi>John Climacus</hi> ſpeaks of certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, who becauſe they could not weep, expreſſed their Repentance by beating their breaſts: and yet if all men could weep when they liſt, yet they may weep and not be ſorrowful; and though they can command tears, yet ſorrow is no more to be commanded then hunger, and therefore is not a part or neceſſary duty of Repentance, when ſorrow is taken for a ſenſitive trouble.</p>
                  <p>But yet there is ſomething of this alſo to be added to our duty.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> If our conſtitution be ſuch as to be apt to weep, and ſenſitively troubled upon other <hi>intellectuall apprehenſions</hi> of differing objects, unleſſe alſo they finde the ſame effect in their Repentances, there will be ſome cauſe to ſuſpect, that their hatred of ſin, and value of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and its rewards, are not ſo great as they ought to be. The Maſters of ſpiritual life give this rule: <hi>Sciat ſe culpabiliter durum, qui deflet damna temporis vel mortem amici, dolorem verò pro peccatis lachrymis non oſtendit.</hi> He that weeps for temporall loſſes, and does not in the ſame manner expreſs his ſorrow for his ſins, is culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obdurate: which propoſition though piouſly
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:115796:322"/>intended is not true. For tears are emanations of a ſenſitive trouble or motion of the heart, and not properly ſubject to the underſtanding; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a man may innocently weep for the death of his friend, and yet ſhed no tears when he hath told a lie, and ſtill be in that ſtate of ſorrow and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, that he had rather die himſelf then chooſe to tell another lie. Therefore the rule onely hath ſome proportions of probability, in the effect of ſeveral <hi>intellectual apprehenſions.</hi> As he that is apt to weep when he hath done an unhandſome action to his friend, who yet will never puniſh him; and is not apt to expreſs his ſorrow in the ſame manner, when he hath offended God: I ſay, he may ſuſpect his ſorrow not to be ſo great or ſo real, but yet ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly from this circumſtance, to weep or not to weep is nothing to the duty of Repentance, ſave onely that it is that ordinary ſigne by which ſome men expreſs ſome ſort of ſorrow. And therefore I underſtand not the meaning of that prayer of S. <hi>Auſtin, Domine da gratiam lachrymarum; Lord give me the grace of tears;</hi> for tears are no duty, and the greateſt ſorrow oftentimes is the drieſt; and excepting that there is ſome ſweetneſs and eaſe in ſhedding tears, and that they accompany a ſoft and a contemplative perſon, an eaſie and a good nature, and ſuch as is apt for religious impreſſions, I know no uſe of them, but to ſignifie in an apt and a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed nature what kinde of apprehenſions and trouble there is within. For <hi>weeping</hi> upon the preſence of <hi>ſecular troubles,</hi> is more <hi>ready</hi> and <hi>eaſie,</hi> becauſe it is an effect ſymbolical, and of the ſame nature with its proper cauſe. But when there is a <hi>ſpiritual cauſe,</hi> although its proper ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect may be <hi>greater</hi> and more <hi>effective</hi> of better purpoſes; yet unleſs by the intermixture of ſome <hi>material</hi> and <hi>natural</hi> cauſe, it be more apportion'd
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:115796:322"/>to a material and natural product, it is not to be charged with it, or expected from it. <hi>Sin</hi> is a <hi>ſpiritual evil,</hi> and <hi>tears</hi> is the ſigne of a <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>phyſical ſorrow. Smart,</hi> and <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and <hi>labour,</hi> are <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>phyſical evils;</hi> and <hi>hatred</hi> and <hi>nolition</hi> is a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> or <hi>intellectual effect.</hi> Now as every labour and every ſmart is not to be hated or rejected, but ſometimes choſen by the underſtanding, when it is mingled with a good that pleaſes the underſtanding, and is eligible upon the accounts of reaſon: So neither can every ſin which is the intellectual evil, be productive of tears or ſenſitive ſorrow, unleſs it be mingled with ſomething which the ſenſe and affections, that is, which the lower man hates, and which will proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly afflict him; ſuch as are, fear, or pain, or danger, or diſgrace, or loſs. The ſenſitive ſorrow therefore which is uſually ſeen in new penitents, is upon the account of thoſe horrible apprehenſions which are declared in holy Scriptures to be the conſequent of ſins; but if we ſhall ſo preach Repentance, as to warrant a freedome and a perfect eſcape inſtantly from all ſignifications of the wrath of God, and all dangers for the future upon the paſt and preſent ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, I know not upon what reckoning he that truly leaves his ſin can be commanded to be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and if he were commanded, how he can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly obey.</p>
                  <p>But when Repentance hath had its growth and progreſſion,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> and is increaſed into a habit of piety, ſorrow and ſenſitive trouble may come in upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other account; for great and permanent changes of the minde, make great impreſſions upon the lower man. When we love an object intenſely, our very body receives comfort in the preſence of it: and there are friendly Spirits which have a natural kindneſs and cognation to each other, and refreſh one another, paſſing from eye to eye, from friend
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:115796:323"/>to friend: and the Prophet <hi>David</hi> felt it in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Religion; <hi>My fleſh and my heart rejoyce in the living Lord.</hi> For if a grief of minde is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of the fleſh, and a cheerful ſpirit is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatory of health, it is certain that every great impreſſion that is made upon the minde and dwells there, hath its effect upon the body and the lower affections. And therefore all thoſe excellent peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents who conſider the baſeneſs of ſin, * their own danger though now paſt in ſome degrees, * the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of God, * the ſecret counſels of his Mercy, * his various manners of diſpenſing them, * the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgements which God unexpectedly ſends upon ſome men, * the dangers of our own confidence, * the weakneſs of our Repentance, * the remains of our ſin, * the aptneſſes and combuſtible nature of our Concupiſcence, * the preſence of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the perils of relapſing, * the evil ſtate of things which our former ſins leave us in, * our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in obeying, and our longings to return to <hi>Egypt,</hi> * and the fearful anger of God which will with greater fierceneſs deſcend if we chance to fall back: Thoſe penitents (I ſay) who conſider theſe things frequently and prudently, will finde their whole man ſo wrought upon, that every faculty ſhall have an enmity againſt ſin; and therefore even the affections of the lower man muſt in their way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to its mortification, and that is by a real and effective ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>But in this whole affair the whole matter of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion will be in the manner of operation,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> or ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the diſlike. For the duty is done if the ſin be accounted an enemy; that is, whether the diſlike be onely in the intellectual and rational appetite, or alſo in the ſenſitive. For although men uſe ſo to ſpeak and diſtinguiſh ſuperior from inferior ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; yet it will be hard in nature to finde any
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:115796:323"/>real diſtinct faculties, in which thoſe paſſions are ſubjected, and from which they have emanation. The intellectual deſire, and the ſenſual deſire are both founded in the ſame faculty; they are not diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by their <hi>ſubjects,</hi> but by their <hi>objects</hi> only: they are but ſeveral motions of the will to or from ſeveral objects. When a man deſires that which is moſt reaſonable, and perfective, or conſonant to the underſtanding, that we call an <hi>intellectual,</hi> or <hi>rational appetite;</hi> but if he deſires a thing that will doe him hurt in his ſoul, or to his beſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and yet he deſires it becauſe it pleaſes him, this is fit to be called <hi>a ſenſitive appetite,</hi> becauſe the object is ſenſitive, and it is choſen for a ſenſual rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But it is rather <hi>appetitio</hi> then <hi>appeti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us,</hi> that is, an act rather then a principle of action. The caſe is plainer, if we take two objects of ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, both of which are proportion'd to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. S. <hi>Anthony</hi> in the <hi>deſert,</hi> and S. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> in the <hi>Pulpit</hi> were tempted by the ſpirit of pride: they reſiſted and overcame it, becauſe pride was unreaſonable and fooliſh as to themſelves, and diſpleaſing to God. If they had liſtned to the whiſpers of that ſpirit, it had been upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of pleaſure, becauſe pride is that deliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit which entertains a vain man, making him to delight in his own images and reflexions; and therefore is a work of the fleſh, but yet plainly founded in the underſtanding. And therefore here it is plain, that when the fleſh and the ſpirit fight, it is not a fight between two faculties of the ſoul, but a conteſt in the ſoul concerning the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of two objects. It is no otherwiſe in this then in every deliberation, when arguments from ſeveral intereſts conteſt each other. Every paſſion of the man is nothing elſe but a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per manner of being affected with an object,
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:115796:324"/>and conſequently a tendency to or an averſion from it, that is, a willing or a nilling of it; which willing and nilling when they produce ſeveral permament impreſſions upon the minde and body receive the names of <hi>divers paſſions:</hi> The object it ſelf firſt ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the fancy or lower apprehenſions by its proper energy, makes the firſt paſſion or tendency to the will, that is, the inclination or firſt concupiſcence; but when the will upon that impreſſion is ſet on work, and chooſes the ſenſual object, that makes the abiding paſſion, the quality. As if the object be diſpleaſing and yet not preſent, it effects <hi>fear</hi> or <hi>hatred;</hi> if good and not preſent, it is called <hi>deſire;</hi> but all theſe diverſifications are meerly natural effects; as to be warm is before the fire, and cannot be in our choice directly and immediately. That which is the prime and proper action of the will, that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is ſubject to a command; that is, to chooſe or refuſe the ſin. The <hi>paſſion,</hi> that is, the proper effect or impreſs upon the fancy or body, that is, natural, and is determin'd to the particular by the mixture of ſomething natural with the act of the will; as if an apprehenſion of future evils be mingled with the refuſing ſin, that is, if it be the cauſe of it: then <hi>fear</hi> is the paſſion that is effected by it. If the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome evil be the cauſe of the nolition, then <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> is the effect; and <hi>fear</hi> alſo may produce <hi>ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> So that the <hi>paſsion,</hi> that is, the natural im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs upon the man cannot be the effect of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, but the principle of that paſſion is, we are commanded to refuſe ſin, <hi>to eſchew evil,</hi> that's the word of the Scripture: but becauſe we uſually doe feel the evils of ſin, and we have reaſon to fear worſe, and ſorrow is the natural effect of ſuch a feeling, and ſuch a fear, therefore the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us to repentance, that is, a new life, a dying unto ſin, and a living unto righteouſneſs, expreſſes
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:115796:324"/>it by ſorrow, and mourning, and weeping; but theſe are not the duty, but the expreſſions, or the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that which is a duty. So that if any man who hates ſin and leaves it, cannot yet finde the ſharpneſs of ſuch a ſorrow as he feels in other ſad accidents, there can nothing be ſaid to it, but that the duty it ſelf is not clothed with thoſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are apt to produce that paſſion; it is not an eſchewing of ſin upon conſiderations of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or a feared trouble, but upon ſome other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; or that the conſideration is not deep and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or that the perſon is of an unapt diſpoſition to thoſe ſenſible effects. The <hi>Italian</hi> and his wife who by chance eſpied a Serpent under the ſhade of their Vines, were both equal haters of the little beaſt; but the wife only cried out, and the man kill'd it, but with as great a regret and horror at the ſight of it as his wife, though he did not ſo expreſs it. But when a little after they eſpied a Lizard, and ſhe cried again, he told her, That he perceiv'd her trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble was not alwayes deriv'd from reaſonable appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and that what could ſpring onely from images of things and fancies of perſons, was not conſiderable by a juſt value. This is the caſe of our ſorrowing. Some expreſs it by tears, ſome by penances and corporal inflictions, ſome by more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective and material mortifications of it: but he that kills it is the greateſt enemy. But thoſe perſons who can be ſorrowful and violently mov'd for a trifling intereſt, and upon the arreſts of fancy, if they finde theſe eaſie meltings and ſenſitive afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the accounts of their ſins, are not to pleaſe themſelves at all, unleſs when they have cried out, they alſo kill the Serpent.</p>
                  <p>I cannot therefore at all ſuſpect that mans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance who hates ſin,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> and chooſes righteouſneſs and walks in it, though he doe not weep, or feel
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:115796:325"/>the troubles of a mother mourning over the hearſe of her onely ſon; but yet ſuch a ſenſitive grief is of great uſe to theſe purpoſes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If it do not proceed from the preſent ſenſe of the Divine judgement, yet it ſupplies that, and feels an evil from its own apprehenſion, which is not yet felt from the Divine infliction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It prevents Gods anger, by being a puniſhment of our ſelves, a condemnation of the ſinner, and a taking vengeance of our ſelves, for our having offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded God. And therefore it is, conſequently to this, agreed on all hands, that the greater the ſorrow is, the leſs neceſſity there is of any outward affliction;

                  <p n="3">3. This ſenſitive ſorrow is very apt to extinguiſh ſin, it being of a ſymbolical nature to the deſign of God, when he ſtrikes a ſinner for his amendment: it makes ſin to be uneaſy to him; and not onely to be diſpleaſing to his ſpirit, but to his ſenſe, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently that it hath no port to enter any more.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is a great ſatisfaction to an inquiſitive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to whom it is not ſufficient that he does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, unleſs he be able to prove it by ſigns and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per indications.</p>
                  <p>The ſum is this.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> No man can in any ſenſe be ſaid to be a true penitent, unleſs he wiſhes he had never done the ſin. 2. But he that is told that his ſin is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently pardon'd upon repentance, that is, upon lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it, and asking forgiveneſs; and that the former pleaſure ſhall not now hurt him, he hath no reaſon to wiſh that he had never done it. 3. But to make it reaſonable to wiſh that the ſin had never been done, there muſt be the feeling or fear of ſome evil.
<q>
                        <l>Conſcia mens ut cuique ſua eſt, ita concipit intra</l>

                     </q> 4. According as is the nature of that evil fear'd or felt, ſo is the paſſion effected, of hatred, or ſorrow. 5. Whatever the paſſion be it muſt be totally exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of all affection to ſin, and produce enmity and fighting againſt it until it be mortified. 6. In the whole progreſſion of this mortification, it is more then probable that ſome degrees of ſenſitive trouble will come in at ſome angle or other. 7. Though the duty of <hi>penitential ſorrow it ſelf</hi> be completed <hi>in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litione peccati,</hi> in the hating of ſin, and our ſelves for doing it, yet the more penal that hate is, the more it miniſters to many excellent purpoſes of repentance.</p>
                  <pb n="598" facs="tcp:115796:326"/>
                  <p>But becauſe ſome perſons doe not feel this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſorrow,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> they begin to ſuſpect their repentance, and therefore they are taught to ſupply this want by a reflex act, that is, to be ſorrowful becauſe they are not ſorrowful. This I muſt needs ſay is a fine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, where it can be made to ſignify ſomething that is material. But I fear it will not often. For how can a man be ſorrowful for not being ſorrowful? For either he hath reaſon at firſt to be ſorrowful, or he hath not. If he hath not, why ſhould he be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful for not doing an unreaſonable act? If he hath reaſon, and knows it, it is certain he will be as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful as that cauſe ſo apprehended can effect: but he can be no more, and ſo much he cannot chooſe but be. But if there be cauſe to be ſorrowful and the man knows it not, then he cannot yet grieve for that; for he knows no cauſe, and that is all one as if he had none. But if there be indeed a cauſe which he hath not conſidered, then let him be called upon to conſider that, and then he will be directly, and truly ſorrowful when he hath conſidered it; and hath reaſon to be ſorrowful becauſe he had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it before, that is, becauſe he had not repented ſooner; but to be ſorrowful becauſe he is not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, can have no other good meaning but this. We are to endevour to be diſpleaſed at ſin, and to uſe all the means we can to hate it, that is, when we finde not any ſenſitive ſorrow or pungency of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, let us contend to make our intellectual ſorrow as great as we can. And if we perceive or ſuſpect we have not true repentance, let us beg of God to give it; and let us uſe the proper means of obtaining the grace; and if we are uncertain concerning the actions of our own heart, let us ſupply them by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and holy deſires; that if we cannot perceive the grace in the proper ſhape, and by its own ſymptoms and indications, we may be made in ſome meaſure,
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:115796:326"/>humbly confident by other images and reflexions; by ſeeing the grace in another ſhape, ſo <hi>David, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oupivi deſiderare juſtificationes tuas,</hi> I have deſired to deſire thy juſtifications; that is, either I have prayed for that grace, or I have ſeen that I have that deſire, not by a direct obſervation, but by ſome other ſignification. But it is certain, no man can be ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful for not being ſorrowful, if he means the ſame kinde and manner of ſorrow; as <hi>there cannot be two where there is not one, and there cannot be a reflex ray where there was not a direct.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if there be ſuch difficulty in the queſtions of our own ſorrow,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> it were very well that even this part of repentance ſhould be conducted as all the other ought, by the miniſtery of a ſpiritual man, that it may be better inſtructed, and prudently managed, and better diſcerned, and led on to its proper effects. But when it is ſo help'd forward, it is more then Contrition, it is Confeſſion alſo; of which I am yet to give in ſpecial accounts.</p>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> Repentance cannot kill ſin, but by withdrawing the will from it: and the will is not to be withdrawn, but by complying with the contrary affection to that which before did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it in evil.

<pb n="600" facs="tcp:115796:327"/>
                     <hi>pleaſure</hi> was the product, it was that which nurs'd or begot the ſin: Now as this pleaſure might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from hope, from poſſeſſion, from ſenſe, from fancy, from deſire, and all the paſſions of the <hi>concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcible appetite;</hi> ſo when there is a <hi>diſpleaſure</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, it will help to deſtroy ſin, from what paſſion ſoever, of what faculty ſoever, that diſpleaſure can be produced.</p>
                  <p>If the diſpleaſure at ſin proceeds from any paſſion of the <hi>iraſcible faculty,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> it is that which thoſe Divines who underſtand the meaning of their own words of art commonly call <hi>Attrition,</hi> that is, <hi>A reſolving againſt ſin, the reſolution proceeding from any prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that is troubleſome and dolorous:</hi> and in what degree of good that is, appears in the ſtating of this Queſtion, it is acceptable to God; <hi>not an acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptable repentance,</hi> for it is not ſo much; but it is a good beginning of it, <hi>an acceptable introduction to it,</hi> and muſt in its very nature ſuppoſe a <hi>ſorrow,</hi> or <hi>diſpleaſure,</hi> in which although according to the quality of the motives of <hi>attrition,</hi> or the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the penitent, there is more or leſs ſenſitive trouble reſpectively, yet in all there muſt be ſo much ſorrow or diſpleaſure, as to cauſe a dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liction of the ſin, or a reſolution, at leaſt, to leave it.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome natures ſo ingenuous,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> and there are ſome periods of repentance ſo perfect, and ſome penitents have ſo farre proceeded in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of holineſs, and pardon, that they are fallen out with ſin upon the ſtock of ſome principles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the <hi>concupiſcible appetite;</hi> ſuch are <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Hope;</hi> and if theſe have for their object God, or the Divine promiſes, it is that nobleſt principle of repentance or holy life, which Divines call <hi>Contrition.</hi> For <hi>hope</hi> cannot be without <hi>love</hi> of that which is hoped for; if therefore this hope have
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:115796:327"/>for its object, temporal purchaſes, it is or may be a ſufficient cauſe of leaving ſin, according as the power and efficacy of the hope ſhall be; but it will not be ſufficient towards pardon, unleſs in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, it joyn with ſome better principle of a ſpiritual grace. Temporal <hi>Hope</hi> and temporal <hi>Fear</hi> may begin Gods work upon our ſpirits; but till it be gone farther, we are not in the firſt ſtep of an actual ſtate of grace. But as <hi>attrition</hi> proceeds from the motives of thoſe diſpleaſing objects, which are threatned by God to be the evil conſequents of ſin, relating to eternity; ſo <hi>Contrition</hi> proceeds from objects and motives of deſire, which are promiſes and benefits, received already, or to be received hereafter. But theſe muſt alſo be more then tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral good things: for hopes and fear relating to things (though promiſed or threatned in holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture) are not ſufficient incentives of a holy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable repentance, which becauſe it is not a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient act, but a ſtate of holineſs, cannot be ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a tranſitory and deficient cauſe, but muſt wholly rely upon expectation and love of things that are eternal and cannot paſs away. <hi>Attrition</hi> begins with fear, <hi>Contrition</hi> hath hope and love in it. The firſt is a good beginning, but it is no more; before a man can ſay he is pardoned, he muſt be gone beyond the firſt, and arrived at this. The reaſon is plain; becauſe although in the beginnings of Repentance there is a great fear, yet the cauſes of this fear wear away and leſſen, according as the repentance goes on, and are quite extinguiſhed, when the penitent hath mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified his ſin, and hath received the ſpirit of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, the <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="602" facs="tcp:115796:328"/>by ſomething that is laſting, and will not wear off, and that is <hi>hope and love;</hi>

                  <p>Now of this <hi>Contrition</hi> relying upon motives of pleaſure and objects of amability,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> being the nobleſt principle of action, and made up of the love of God, and holy things, and holy expectations, the <hi>product</hi> is quite differing from that of <hi>attrition,</hi> or the imperfect repentance; for that commencing upon fear or diſpleaſure, is onely apt to produce a dereliction or quitting of our ſin, and all the ſervile affections of frighted or diſpleaſed perſons. But this would not effect an univerſal obedience; which onely can be effected by <hi>love</hi> and the affection of ſons; which is alſo the product of thoſe objects, which are the incentives of the divine love, and is called <hi>Contrition;</hi> that is, a hatred againſt ſin as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an enemy to God, and all our hopes of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, whom becauſe this repenting man loves and delights in, he alſo hates whatſoever God hates, and is really griev'd, for ever having offended ſo good a God, and for having endangered his hopes of dwelling with him whom he ſo loves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now does the quite contrary.</p>
                  <p>Now this is not uſually the beginning of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> but is a great progreſſion in it; and it contains in it <hi>obedience.</hi> He that is <hi>attrite</hi> leaves his ſin; but he that is <hi>contrite</hi> obeys God, and purſues the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and acquiſts of vertue: ſo that <hi>Contrition</hi> is not onely a ſorrow for having offended God, whom the penitent loves; that is but one act or effect of <hi>Contrition;</hi> but <hi>Contrition</hi> loves God and hates ſin, it leaves this, and adheres to him, abſtains from evil
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:115796:328"/>and does good; dies to ſin, and lives to righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is a ſtate of pardon and acceptable ſervices.</p>
                  <p>But then there is a ſorrow alſo proper to it;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> For as this grace comes from the nobleſt paſſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, ſo it does operate in the beſt manner, and to the nobleſt purpoſes. It hates ſin upon higher contemplations, then he that hates it upon the ſtock of fear: he hates ſin as being againſt God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and right reaſon, that is, he is gone farther from ſin: He hates it for it ſelf.

                  <p>THe modern Schoolmen make Contrition to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> a reſolution to ſubmit to the Keyes of the Church; that is, that Confeſſion to a Prieſt is a part of Contrition, <hi>as Contrition is taken for a part of Repentance:</hi> for it is incomplete till the Church hath taken notice of it, but by ſubmiſſion to the <hi>Church Tribunal,</hi> it is made complete, and not onely ſo, but that which was but <hi>Attrition,</hi> is now turned into Contrition, or perfect Repentance. In the examining of this, I ſhall, becauſe it is reaſonable ſo to doe, change their manner of ſpeaking, that the inquiry may be more material and intelligible. <hi>That Contrition does include in it a reſolution to ſubmit to the Church Tribunal,</hi> muſt either mean, that <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> does in its nature include a deſire of Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a Prieſt, and then the very word confutes the thing; or elſe by <hi>Contrition</hi> they meaning ſo much of Repentance as is ſufficient to pardon, mean alſo that to ſubmit to the Keyes, or to confeſs to a Prieſt is a neceſſary or integral part of that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore of <hi>Contrition.</hi> Concerning the other part of their affirmative, that <hi>Attrition is by the Keyes chang'd into Contrition;</hi> this being turned into words fit for men to ſpeak, ſuch men (I mean) that would be underſtood, ſignifies plainly this: That the moſt imperfect Repentance towards God, is ſufficient if it be brought before the Church; that is, a little on the penitent mans part, and a little on the Prieſts part, is diſpoſition enough to the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of a pardon: So that, provided you doe all
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:115796:330"/>that the Church commands you, you may make the bolder to leave out ſomething of Gods command, which otherwiſe you might not doe. The Prieſt may doe half the work for you. Theſe thus repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, I ſhall conſider apart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> Confeſſion is an act of Repentance highly requiſite to its perfection, and in that regard parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly called upon in holy Scripture. But concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning this, and all the other great exerciſes, actions or general ſignifications of Repentance, every word ſingly is uſed indefinitely for the whole duty of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Thus <hi>Contrition</hi> is uſed by <hi>David; A broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou ſhalt not deſpiſe;</hi> that is, a penitent heart God will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The ſame alſo is the uſage of <hi>Confeſſion</hi> by S. <hi>John;
<note place="margin">1 Joh. 1.9.</note> If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs;</hi> that is, if we repent, God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us pardon and his holy Spirit, that he will ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us, and that he will ſanctifie us. And in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of this, the Church called <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> by the name of <hi>Exomologeſis,</hi> which though it was a Greek word, yet both Greeks and Latines uſed it. <hi>Exomolegeſis eſt humiliandi hominis diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plina.</hi> So <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Confeſſion is the diſcipline of humiliation for a man for his ſins: and S. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe</hi> calls Confeſſion <hi>poenarum compendium,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">De Abel &amp; Cain. l. 2. c. 9.</note> the ſum or abbreviature of <hi>penance.</hi> And this word was ſometimes chang'd, and called <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> which although the Latine Church in the later ages uſe onely for corporal auſterities, which by way of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation they are pleaſed alſo to call <hi>Penances,</hi> yet it was anciently uſed for the whole courſe and offices of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Repentance;</hi> as appears in the Councel of
<note n="a" place="margin">Lib. 1. c. ult.</note> 
                     <hi>Paris,</hi> of

                     <hi>Agatho,</hi> and the
<note n="c" place="margin">Cap. 11.</note> third Councel of <hi>Toledo.</hi> The reſult and effect of this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is, that no more be put upon one part or
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:115796:330"/>action of Repentance then upon another, to ſerve ends. For pardon of ſins is promis'd to the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent under ſingle words; under <hi>Contrition,</hi> under <hi>Sorrow,</hi> under <hi>Alms,</hi> under <hi>judging our ſelves,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Confeſſion;</hi> but no one of theſe alone is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for pardon: and when pardon is promiſed to any one, they muſt mean the whole duty; for <hi>when the whole effect is aſcribed to a part, that part ſtands for the whole, and meanes more then a part.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Now if any one ſhall inquire to what purpoſe it is that we ſhould confeſs our ſins to God who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready knows them all,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="36"/> eſpecially ſince to doe ſo can be no part of mortification to the mans ſpirit: For if I ſteal in the preſence of my brother, afterwards to tell him who ſaw me, that I did that which he ſaw me doe, is no confuſion of face. That which will be an anſwer to this, and make it appear neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:115796:332"/>to confeſs to God, will alſo make it appear, not to be neceſſary to confeſs to men, in reſpect, I ſay, of any abſolute neceſſity of the thing, or eſſential obligation of the perſon.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, that <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of ſins as it is ſimply ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for <hi>enumeration of the actions</hi> and kindes of ſin, can ſignifie nothing as to God, for the reaſons now mention'd in the inquiry. But when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to confeſs our ſins, it is nothing elſe but another <hi>expreſſion</hi> or <hi>word</hi> for the Commandement of <hi>Repentance.</hi> For, <hi>Confeſs your ſins,</hi> means, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that you have done amiſs, that you were in the wrong way, that you were a miſerable perſon, wandring out of the paths of God, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of heaven and happineſs, that you ought not to have done ſo, that you have ſinn'd againſt God, and broken his holy laws, and therefore are liable and expos'd to all that wrath of God which he will inflict upon you, or which he threatned. Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins is a juſtification of God, and a ſenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of our ſelves. This is not onely certain in the nature of the thing it ſelf; but apparent alſo in the words of <hi>David;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4.</note> Againſt thee onely have I done this evil; ut tu juſtificeris, that thou mighteſt be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified in thy ſaying, and clear when thou art judged.</hi> That is, if I be a ſinner, then art thou righteous and juſt in all the evils thou inflicteſt. So that Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſins is like Confeſſion of faith, nothing but a ſignification of our conviction; it is a publication of our diſlike of ſin, and a ſubmiſſion to the law of God, and a deprecation of the conſequent evils. <hi>Confeſſio error is,
<note place="margin">In Pſ. 135.</note> profeſſio eſt deſinendi,</hi> ſaid S. <hi>Hilary: a confeſſion of our ſin, is a profeſſion that we will leave it;</hi> and again, <hi>Confeſſio peccati ea eſt, ut ià quod à te geſtum eſt per confeſſionem peccati confitearis eſſe pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum.</hi> That is confeſſion of ſins, not that we enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the particulars, and tell the matter of fact to
<pb n="611" facs="tcp:115796:332"/>him that remembers them better then we can, but it is a condemning of the ſin it ſelf, an acknowledging that we have done fooliſhly, a bringing it forth to be crucified and killed. This is apparent alſo in the caſe of <hi>Achan,</hi> who was ſufficiently convict of the matter of fact by the Divine diſpoſing of lots, which was one of the ways by which God anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſecret inquiries of the Jews; but when he was brought forth to puniſhment,
<note place="margin">Joſhua 7.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Joſhua ſaid unto him, My ſon, give I pray thee, glory to the Lord God of Iſrael, and make confeſſion unto him;</hi> that is, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the anſwer of God to be true, and his judgement upon us not to be cauſleſs.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> To this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that part of <hi>Achans</hi> reply; <hi>Indeed I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> There God was juſtified, and the glory was given to him, that is, the glory of his Truth and his Juſtice; but then <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> addes, <hi>and tell me now what thou haſt done; hide it not from me.</hi> Here it was fit he ſhould make a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enumeration of the fact; and ſo he did to <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſaying, <hi>Thus and thus have I done.</hi> For to <hi>confeſs to man;</hi> is another thing then to <hi>confeſs to God.</hi> Men need to be informed, God needs it not; but God is to be juſtified and glorified in the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and condemnation of the ſin or the ſinner: and in order to it, we muſt confeſs our ſin, that is, condemne it, confeſs it to be a ſin, and our ſelves guilty, and ſtanding at Gods mercy. S.
<note place="margin">In 1 Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hom. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> upon thoſe words of S. <hi>Paul, If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged,</hi> hath theſe words, <hi>He ſaith not, if we would chaſtiſe our ſelves, if we would puniſh our ſelves, but onely, if we would acknowledge our ſins, if we would condemn our ſelves, if we would give ſentence againſt our ſins, we ſhould be freed from that puniſhment which is due both here and there. For he that hath condemned himſelf, appeaſes God upon a double account; both becauſe he hath acknowledged
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:115796:333"/>the ſins paſt, and is more careful for the future.</hi> To this confeſſion of ſins is oppoſed, the denying our ſin, our hiding it from God as <hi>Adam</hi> did, that is, either by <hi>proceeding</hi> in it, or by not <hi>conſidering</hi> it, or by <hi>excuſing</hi> it, or by <hi>juſtifying</hi> it, or by <hi>glorying</hi> in it: all theſe are high provocations of Gods anger; but this anger is taken off by confeſſion.
<note place="margin">Pſal. 95.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Praeveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amus faciem eius in confeſſione,</hi> ſaid the <hi>Pſalmiſt: Let us come before his preſence with thankſgiving;</hi> ſo we reade it; <hi>let us prevent his anger,</hi> or, <hi>let us goe before his face with confeſsion,</hi> ſo the old Latin Bibles: which is a doing as the Prodigal did, <hi>I will goe unto my Father, and ſay unto him, Father I have ſinned againſt heaven and againſt thee:</hi> and this is the firſt act of exterior repentance; but it is of that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that is indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation;
<note place="margin">Acts 20.21.</note> this is <hi>Repentance towards God,</hi> which the Apoſtles preach'd in the firſt publication of Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But then beſides this,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="38"/> there is a <hi>Repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men,</hi> and a Confeſſion in order to it. If I have ſinn'd againſt my brother, I muſt ask his pardon and confeſs my error, that is, I muſt repent or confeſs to him; for he that is the injur'd perſon hath a right over me; I am his debtor, and oblig'd; and he can forgive me if he pleaſe, and he may chooſe: that is, I muſt pay him the debt I owe him, unleſs he will be pleaſed to remit it. For God in his infinite wiſdome and goodneſs, and juſtice hath taken care to ſecure every mans intereſt; and he that takes any thing from me, is bound by Gods law to reſtore it, and to reſtore me to that ſtate of good things from whence he forc'd me. Now becauſe for the injury which I have already ſuffered, he cannot make me equal amends, becauſe what ever he does to me for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſtill it is true that I did ſuffer evil from him formerly; therefore it is neceſſary that I doe what I can to the reparation of that; but becauſe what
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:115796:333"/>is done and paſt cannot be undone, I muſt make it up as well as I can; that is, I muſt confeſs my ſin, and be ſorry for it, and ſubmit to the judgement of the offended party, and he is bound to forgive me the ſin; and I am bound to make juſt and prudent amends according to my power; for here every one is bound to doe his ſhare. If the <hi>offending perſon</hi> hath done his part of duty, the <hi>offended</hi> muſt do his, that is, he muſt forgive him that wrong'd him; if he will not, God will untie the penitent man, and with the ſame chain faſt binde him that is uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable.</p>
                  <p>But my brother may be hurt by me,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="39"/> though I have taken nothing from him, nor intended him injury. He may be ſcandalized by my ſin, that is, tempted to ſin, incouraged in his vileneſs, or diſcontented and made ſorrowful for my unworthineſs and tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In all theſe caſes it is neceſſary that we <hi>repent to them</hi> alſo; that is, that we make amends not only by confeſſion to God, but to our brethren alſo. For when we acknowledge our folly, we affright them from it; and by repentance we give them caution, that they may not deſcend into the ſame ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felicity. And upon this account all publick crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals were tied to a publick <hi>Exomologeſis</hi> or Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the Church, who by confeſſion of their ſins, acknowledged their error, and entred into the ſtate of repentance; and by their being ſeparate from the participation and <hi>communion</hi> of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, were declared unworthy of a communion with Chriſt, and a participation of his promiſes, till by repentance, and the fruits worthy of it, they were adjudged capable of Gods pardon.</p>
                  <p>At the firſt this was as the nature of the thing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted it,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="40"/> in caſe of publick and notorious crimes, ſuch which had done injury, and wrought publick ſcandal: and ſo far was neceſſary, that the Church
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:115796:334"/>ſhould be repaired if ſhe have been injured: if publick ſatisfaction be demanded, it muſt be done; if private be required onely, then that is ſufficient; though in caſe of notorious crimes it were very well, if the penitent would make his repentance as exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary as <hi>Modeſty,</hi> and his own and the publick cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances can permit.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of this in the Primitive Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="41"/> the Biſhop and whom he deputed, did miniſter to theſe publick ſatisfactions and amends; which cuſtome of theirs admitted of variety and change according as <hi>new ſcandals</hi> or <hi>new neceſſities</hi> did ariſe. For though by the nature of the thing, they onely could be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily and eſſentially obliged who had done pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and notorious offences; yet ſome obſerving the advantages of that way of repentance, the prayers of the Church, the tears of the Biſhop, the compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the faithful, the joy of abſolution and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation, did come in voluntarily, and to doe that by choice, which the notorious criminals were to do of neceſſity.</p>
                  <p>Then the Prieſts which the penitents had choſen, did publiſh or enjoyn them to publiſh their ſins in the face of the Church, but this grew into lerable, and was left off, becauſe it grew to be a matter of accuſation before the criminal Judge, and of upbrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in private converſation, and of confidence to them that ſought for occaſion and hardneſs of heart and face, and <hi>therefore they appointed</hi> one onely Prieſt to hear the caſes, and receive the addreſſes of the penitents; and he did publiſh the ſins of them that came, onely in general, and by the publication of their penances, and their ſeparation from the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries; and <hi>this alſo changed</hi> into the more private; and by ſeveral ſteps of progreſſion dwindled away into <hi>private repentance towards men,</hi> that is, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to a Prieſt in private, and private ſatisfactions,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:115796:334"/>or amends and fruits of repentance: and now, <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular Confeſſion</hi> is nothing elſe but the publick <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omologeſis,</hi> or <hi>Repentance Eccleſiaſtical reduced to aſhes;</hi> it is the relicks of that excellent Diſcipline, which was in ſome caſes neceſſary (as I have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) and in very many caſes uſeful, until by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of manners, and the extinction of charity it became unſufferable, and a bigger ſcandal then thoſe which it did intend to remedy. The reſult is this. That to enumerate our ſins before the Holy man that miniſters in holy things, that is, <hi>Confeſſion to a Prieſt</hi> is not virtually included in the duty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition; for it not being neceſſary by the nature of the thing, nor the Divine Commandement, is not neceſſary abſolutely, and properly, in order to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; and therefore is no part of Contrition which without this may be a ſufficient diſpoſition towards pardon, unleſs by accident, as in the caſe of ſcandal, the criminal come to be obliged. Onely this one advantage is to be made of their doctrine who ſpeak otherwiſe in this article. The Divines in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of <hi>Trent</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Seſſ. 14. c. 4.</note> affirm, that they that are contrite are reconciled to God before they receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of penance, (as they uſe to ſpeak) that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Prieſtly abſolution. If then a man can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite before the Prieſt abſolves him, as their ſaying ſuppoſes, and as it is certain they may, and if the deſire of abſolution be as they ſay included in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and conſequently that nothing is wanting to obtain pardon to the penitent even before the Prieſt abſolves him; it follows that the Prieſts abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution following this perfect diſpoſition, and this actual pardon, can effect nothing really; the man is pardon'd before-hand, and therefore his abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely <hi>declarative.</hi> God pardons the man, and the Prieſt by his office is to tell him ſo, when he ſees cauſe for it, and obſerves the conditions
<pb n="616" facs="tcp:115796:335"/>completed. Indeed if abſolution by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Church were neceſſary, then to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it alſo would be neceſſary, and an act of duty and obedience; but then if the deſire (in caſe it were neceſſary to deſire it) would make Contrition to be complete and perfect, and if perfect contrition does actually procure a pardon, then the Prieſtly abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is onely a ſolemn and legal publication of Gods pardon already actually paſt in the Court of heaven. For an effect cannot proceed from cauſes which are not yet in being; and therefore the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of the ſins for which the penitent is contrite, cannot come from the Prieſts miniſtration which is not in ſome caſes to be obtain'd, but deſir'd only, and afterwards when it can be obtain'd, comes when the work is done. God it may be accepts the deſire, but the Prieſts miniſtery afterwards is not, cannot be the cauſe, why God did accept of that deſire; becauſe the deſire is accepted, before the abſolution is in being.</p>

                  <p>For in this caſe the Church hath a power of bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="45"/> and retaining ſins and ſinners; that is, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying to them the privileges of the faithful, till they by publick repentance and ſatisfaction have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven teſtimony of their return to Gods favour and ſervice. The Church may deny to pray publickly for ſome perſons, and refuſe to admit them into the ſociety of thoſe that doe pray, and refuſe till ſhe is ſatisfied concerning them, by ſuch ſigns and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications as ſhe will appoint and chooſe. For it appears in both Teſtaments, that thoſe who are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to pray for others, to ſtand between God and the people, had it left in their choice ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:115796:337"/>and ſometimes were forbidden to pray for certain criminals. Thus God gave to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet charge concerning <hi>Ephraim:
<note place="margin">Jer. 7.16.</note> Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make interceſsion for them, for I will not hear thee.</hi> Like to this was that of S. <hi>John; There is a ſin unto death. I ſay not that ye pray for him that ſins unto death;</hi> that is, doe not admit ſuch perſons to the communion of prayers and holy offices; at leaſt the Church may chooſe whether ſhe will or no.</p>
                  <p>The Church in her Government and Diſcipline had two ends,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="46"/> and her power was accordingly, apt to miniſter to theſe ends; 1. By condemning and puniſhing the ſin, ſhe was to doe what ſhe could to ſave the criminal; that is, by bringing him to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance &amp; a holy life, to bring him to pardon: 2. And if ſhe could, or if ſhe could not effect this, yet ſhe was to remove the ſcandal, and ſecure the flock from infection; This was all that was needful, this was all that was poſſible to be done. In order to the firſt, the Apoſtles had ſome powers extraordinary, which were indeed neceſſary at the beginning of the Religion, not onely for this, but for other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations. The Apoſtles had power to <hi>binde ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;</hi> that is, <hi>to deliver them over to Satan,</hi> and to ſad diſeaſes, or death it ſelf: and they had <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to looſe ſinners,</hi> that is, to cure their diſeaſes, to <hi>unlooſe Satans bands,</hi> to reſtore them to Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and pardon.</p>
                  <p>This manner of ſpeaking was uſed by our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour in this very caſe of ſickneſs and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity:
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="47"/> 
                     <hi>Ought not this woman, a daughter of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, whom Satan hath bound, lo theſe eighteen years, be looſed from this band on the Sabbath day?</hi> The Apoſtles had this power of binding and looſing; and that this is the power of remitting and retaining ſins, appears without exception, in the words of
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:115796:338"/>our bleſſed Saviour to the Jews, who beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the power of forgiving ſins by ſeeing the evil which ſin brought on the guilty perſon taken away. <hi>That ye may know that the Son of Man hath power on earth to forgive ſins; He ſaith to the man ſick of the palſy, Ariſe, take up thy bed and walk.</hi> For there is a power in heaven, and a power on earth to forgive ſins. The power that is in heaven, is the publick abſolution of a ſinner at the day of judgement. The power on earth to forgive ſins, is a taking off thoſe intermedial evils which are inflicted in the way; ſickneſſes, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral death, loſs of the Divine grace, and of the privileges of the faithful; Theſe Chriſt could take off when he was upon earth, and his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſent him to do all this, to heal all ſickneſſes, and to cure all infirmities, and to take away our ſins, and to preach glad tidings to the poor, and comfort to the afflicted, and reſt to the weary and heavy laden, The other judgement is to be perform'd by Chriſt at his ſecond coming.</p>
                  <p>Now as God the Father ſent his Son,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="48"/> ſo his holy Son ſent his Apoſtles, with the ſame power on earth to binde and looſe ſinners, to pardon ſins by taking away the material evil effects which ſin ſhould ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perinduce; or to retain ſinners by binding them in ſad and hard bands to bring them to reaſon, or to make others afraid. Thus S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſentenc'd <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to a temporal death: and <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſtroke <hi>Elymas</hi> with blindneſs, and deliver'd over the inceſtuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> to be beaten by an evil ſpirit, and ſo alſo he did to <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xander.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this was an extraordinary power,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="49"/> and not to deſcend upon the ſucceeding ages of the Church: but it was in this as in all other miniſteries; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing miraculous and extraordinary, was for ever to
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:115796:338"/>conſign a laſting truth and miniſtery in ordinary. The preaching of the Goſpel, that is, <hi>faith</hi> it ſelf, at firſt, was prov'd by miracles; and the holy Ghoſt was given by ſigns and wonders, and ſins were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd by the gifts of healing; and ſins were retained by the hands of an angel, and the very viſitation of the ſick was bleſſed with ſenſible and ſtrange reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries; and every thing was accompanied with a miracle, excepting the two Sacraments, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of which we doe not finde any mention of any thing viſibly miraculous in the records of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and the reaſon is plain, becauſe theſe two Sacraments were to be for ever the ordinary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteries of thoſe graces which at firſt were conſign'd by ſigns and wonders extraordinary. For in all ages of the Church reckoning excluſively from the days of the Apoſtles, all the graces of the Goſpel, all the promiſes of God were conveyed, or conſign'd, or fully miniſtred by theſe Sacraments, and by nothing elſe, but what was in order to them. Theſe were the inlets and doors by which all the faithful were admitted into the outer Courts of the Lords Temple, or into the ſecrets of the Kingdome; and the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities themſelves were the keys of theſe doors; and they that had the power of miniſtration of them, they had the power of the keys.</p>
                  <p>Theſe then being the whole Eccleſiaſtical power,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="50"/> and the ſum of their miniſtrations, were to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed according to the neceſſities and differing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities of the ſons and daughters of the Church. The <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> who were not furniſhed with a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent number of Eccleſiaſtical Governours, were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to <hi>abſtain from the company of the brethren that walk'd diſorderly.</hi> S. <hi>John</hi> wrote to the <hi>Elect Lady,</hi> that ſhe ſhould not entertain in her houſe falſe Apoſtles: and when the former way did expire of it ſelf, and by the change of things, and the ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:115796:339"/>was not practicable and prudent, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the onely ordinary miniſtery of remitting and retaining ſins, by a direct admitting, or refuſing and deferring to admit criminals to their miniſteries of pardon, which were now onely left in the Church, as their ordinary power and miniſtration. For ſince in this world all our ſins are pardon'd by thoſe ways and inſtruments which God hath conſtituted in the Church; and there are no other external rites appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt but the Sacraments, it follows, that as they are worthily communicated or juſtly denied, ſo the pardon is or is not miniſtred.</p>
                  <p>And therefore when the Church did binde any ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by the bands of Diſcipline, ſhe did remove him from the myſteries, and ſometimes enjoyn'd <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> or <hi>internal</hi> acts of repentance, to <hi>teſtify</hi> and to <hi>exerciſe</hi> the grace, and ſo to diſpoſe them to pardon; and when the penitents had given ſuch teſtimonies which the Church demanded, then they were abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is, they were admitted to the myſteries. For in the primitive records of the Church, there was no form of abſolution judicial, nothing but giving them the holy Communion, admitting them to the peace of the Church, to the ſociety and privileges of the faithful For this was giving them pardon, by vertue of thoſe words of Chriſt, <hi>Whoſe ſins ye remit they are remitted;</hi> that is, if ye who are the Stewards of my family ſhall admit any one to the Kingdom of Chriſt on earth, they ſhall be admitted to the participation of Chriſts Kingdom in Heaven; and what ye binde here, ſhall be bound there; that is, if they be unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to partake of Chriſt here, they ſhall be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unworthy to partake of Chriſt hereafter; if they ſeparate from Chriſts members, they alſo ſhall be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the head; and this is the full ſenſe of the power given by Chriſt to his Church, concerning ſins and ſinners, called by S. <hi>Paul, the word of reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="625" facs="tcp:115796:339"/>
                  <p>For as for the other later and ſuperinduc'd Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of pardon in judicial forms of abſolution; that is wholly upon other accounts, of good uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to all them that deſire it by reaſon of their preſent perſwaſions and ſcruples, fears and jealouſies concerning the event of things. For ſometimes it happens what one ſaid of old; <hi>Mens noſtra difficilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè ſedatur; Deus faciliùs.</hi> God is ſooner at peace with us, then we are at peace with our own mindes; and becauſe our repentances are always imperfect; and he who repents the moſt excellently, and hates his ſin with the greateſt deteſtation, may poſſibly by his ſenſe of the foulneſs of his ſin, undervalue his repentance, and ſuſpect his ſorrow, and becauſe every thing is too little to deſerve pardon, he may think it is too little to obtain it; and the man may be melancholy, and melancholy is fearful, and fear is ſcrupulous, and ſcruples are not to be ſatisfied at home, and not very eaſily abroad; in the midſt of theſe and many other diſadvantages, it will be neceſſary that he whoſe office it is to ſeparate the vile from the precious, and to judge of leproſie, ſhould be made able to judge of the ſtate of this mans repentance, and upon notice of particulars, to ſpeak comfort to him or ſomething for inſtitution. For then if the Miniſter of holy things ſhall think fit to pronounce abſolution, that is, to declare that he believes him to be a true penitent and in the ſtate of grace, it muſt needs adde much comfort to him and hope of pardon, not only upon the confidence of his wiſdome and ſpiritual learning, but even from the prayers of the holy man, and the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his miniſtration; To pronounce abſolution in this caſe, is to warrant him ſo farre as his caſe is warrantable: That is, to ſpeak comfort to him that is in need: to give ſentence in a caſe which is laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; in which the party intereſted, either hath
<pb n="626" facs="tcp:115796:340"/>no ſkill, or no confidence, or no comfort. Now in this caſe to diſpute whether the Prieſts power be <hi>Judicial,</hi> or <hi>Optative,</hi> or <hi>Declarative,</hi> is ſo wholly to no purpoſe; that this ſentence is no part of any power at all; but it is his office to do it, and is an effect of wiſdom, not of power; it is like the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering of a queſtion, which indeed ought to be askt of him; as every man prudently is to inquire in every matter of concernment, from him who is skill'd and experienced, and profeſt in the faculty. But the Prieſts <hi>proper power of abſolving,</hi> that is, of <hi>pardoning</hi> (which is in no caſe communicable to any man who is not conſecrated to the Miniſtery) is a giving the penitent the means of eternal pardon, the admitting him to the ſacraments of the Church, and the peace and communion of the faithful; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the only way really to obtain pardon of God; there being <hi>in ordinary</hi> no way to heaven but by ſerving God in the way which he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us by his Son, that is, in the way of the Church, which is his body, whereof he is Prince and Head. The Prieſt is the Miniſter of holy things; he does that by his Miniſtery, which God effects by real diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; and as he gives the Spirit not by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and proper efflux, but by aſſiſting and diſpenſing thoſe rites, and promoting thoſe graces which are certain diſpoſitions to the receiving of him: juſt ſo he gives <hi>pardon;</hi> not as a <hi>thing</hi> does it; nor yet as a <hi>Meſſenger;</hi> that is, not by way of <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>real donation;</hi> nor yet only by <hi>declaration:</hi> but as a Rhyſician gives health; that is, he gives the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which God appoints; and if he does ſo, and if God bleſſes the medicines, the perſon recovers, and God gives the health.</p>
                  <p>For it is certain that the holy man who miniſters in repentance hath no other proper power of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving pardon then what is now deſcribed.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="52"/> Becauſe
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:115796:340"/>he cannot pardon them who are not truly penitent, and if the ſinner be, God will pardon him, whether The Prieſt does or no; and what can be the effect of theſe things, but this; that the Prieſt does only mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to the pardon, as he miniſters to repentance? He tells us upon what conditions God does pardon, and judges beſt when the conditions are performed, and ſets forward thoſe conditions by his proper mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and miniſters to us the inſtruments of grace, but firſt takes accounts of our ſoules, and helps us who are otherwiſe too partial, to judge ſevere, and righteous judgement concerning our eternal intereſt, and he judges for us, and does exhort or reprove, admoniſh or correct, comfort or humble, looſe or binde. So the Miniſter of God, is the Miniſter of reconciliation: that is, he is the Miniſter of the Goſpel; for that is the <hi>Word of Reconciliation</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms to be intruſted to him: in every of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by which the holy man miniſters to the Goſpel, in every of them he is the Miniſter of pardon.</p>
                  <p>But concerning that which we call <hi>Abſolution,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="53"/> that is, a pronouncing the perſon to be abſolved; it is certain that the forms of the preſent uſe, were not uſed for many ages of the Church: In the <hi>Greek</hi> Church they were never uſed; and for the Latine Church in <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> his time they were ſo new that he put it into one of his <hi>Quaeſtiones diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatae</hi> whether form were more fit, the <hi>Optative</hi> or the <hi>Judicial;</hi> whether it were better to ſay; <hi>[God of his mercy pardon thee]</hi> or [<hi>by his authority</hi> committed to me, I abſolve thee] and in <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> days when it was eſteemed an innocent doctrine to ſay that the Prieſts power was only <hi>declarative,</hi> it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the form of abſolution would be according to the power believed; which not being then univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be <hi>Judicial,</hi> the <hi>Judicial</hi> form could not be of univerſal uſe; and in the <hi>Pontifical</hi> there is
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:115796:341"/>no <hi>Judicial form</hi> at all; but only <hi>Optative</hi> or by way of <hi>prayer.</hi> But in this affair, beſides what is already mentioned; I have two great things to ſay which are a ſufficient determination of this whole article.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="54"/> The firſt is, that in the Primitive Church there was no ſuch thing as a judicial abſolution of ſins uſed in any Liturgy, or Church, ſo far as can appear; but all the abſolution of penitents which is recorded, was the meer admitting them to the myſteries and ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the faithful in religious offices, the ſum and perfection of which was the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper. So the fourth Councel of <hi>Carthage Can.</hi> 76. makes proviſion for a penitent that is neer death; <hi>reconcilietur per manus impoſitionem, &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundatur ori ejus Euchariſtia:</hi> let him be reconciled by the impoſition of hands, and let the Euchariſt be poured into his mouth: that was all the ſolemnity; even when there was the greateſt need of the Churches miniſtery; that is, before their penances and ſatisfactions were completed. The Prieſt or Biſhop laid his hands upon him, and prayed, and gave him the Communion. For that this was the whole purpoſe of impoſition of hands, we are taught expreſſely by S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 3. de baptiſm. cap. 16.</note> who being to prove that impoſition of hands, <hi>viz.</hi> in repentance, might be repeated, though baptiſme might not; uſes this for an argument, <hi>Quid enim eſt aliud niſi oratio ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hominem?</hi> It is nothing elſe but a <hi>Prayer ſaid over the man.</hi> And indeed this is evident and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in matter of fact; for in the beginning and in the progreſſion, in the ſeveral periods of publick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and in the conſummation of it, the Biſhop or the Prieſt did very often impoſe hands, that is, pray over the penitent;
<note place="margin">Tertio tomo con. Gall. c. 8. &amp; 11.</note> as appears in <hi>Iſ. Ling.</hi> from the authority of the <hi>Gallican Councels: Omni tempore jejuniis manus poenitentibus à Sacerdotibus imponan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:</hi>

The ſame with that which he alſo obſerves out of the <hi>Nicene Councel;
<note place="margin">Cap. 16. &amp; 17.</note> Vultu &amp; capite humiliato humilitèr &amp; ex corde veniam poſtulent, &amp; pro ſe or are expoſcant:</hi> that's the intent of impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of hands; let the penitent humbly ask pardon that is, deſire that the holy man and all the Church would pray for him: This in every ſtage or period of repentance was a degree of reconciliation: for as God pardons a ſinner when he gives him time to repent; he pardons him in one degree, that is, he hath taken off that anger which might juſtly and inſtantly cruſh him all in pieces, and God pardons him yet more when he exhorts him to repentance, and yet more when he inclines him, and as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, ſo does God, but the pardon is not ful, and final till the repentance is ſo too: So does the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of repentance and pardon: Thoſe only are in the unpardoned ſtate who are cut off from all enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in holy things, with holy perſons, in holy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; when they are admitted to do repentance, they are admitted to the ſtate of pardon; and every time the Biſhop, or Miniſter prayes for him, he ſtill ſets him forwarder towards the final pardon; but then the penitent is fully reconciled on earth, when having done his <hi>repentance towards</hi> men, that is, by the commands of the Church, he is admitted to the holy Communion; and if <hi>that</hi> be ſincerely done on the penitents part, and <hi>this</hi> be maturely and prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:115796:342"/>done on the Prieſts part; as the repentance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men was a repentance alſo towards God: ſo the abſolution before men is a certain indication of abſolution before God: But as to the main queſtion; Then the Church only did reconcile penitents when ſhe admitted them to the Communion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the ſecond Councel of <hi>Carthage,
<note place="margin">Can. 4.</note> abſolution</hi> is called, <hi>reconciliari Divinis altaribus,</hi> a being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the altar of God: and in the Councel of <hi>Eliberis, Communione reconciliari,</hi> a being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled by receiving the Communion,
<note place="margin">Can. 72.</note> oppoſite to which in the ſame Canon is, <hi>Communionem non ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiat;</hi> he may not receive the Communion, that is, he ſhall not be abſolved. The ſame is to be ſeen in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Canon of the Councel of <hi>Ancyra,</hi> in the ſecond Canon of the Councel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> in the 85 epiſtle of <hi>P. Leo;</hi>

<pb n="631" facs="tcp:115796:342"/>ſo univerſal a practice, and proceſſe of Eccleſiaſtical repentance, that without any alteration (as to the main inquiry) it continued ſo in the Church to very many ages ſucceeding, and it was for a long while together the cuſtome of penitent people in the beginning of <hi>Lent</hi> to come voluntarily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive injunctions of diſcipline and penitential offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the Prieſt, and to abſtain from the holy Communion till they had done their penances, and then by ceremonies and prayers to be reſtored to the Communion at <hi>Eaſter;</hi> without any other form of Judicial abſolution,
<note place="margin">De diverſ.

                     <note place="margin">lib. 3. Ep. 17. 2 Cor. 2.10. de Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cra. diſt. 4 cap.

The reſult of which is, that this abſolution of penitents in the Court Chriſtian, was not an act of Prieſtly power <hi>incommunicably;</hi> it was not a diſpenſation of the proper power of the keys, but to give, or not to give the Communion; that was an effect of the power of the keys; that was really, properly, and in effect, the Eccleſiaſtical abſolution; for that which the Deacons, or Confeſſors, the Laics or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumens did, was all that, and only that which was of rite or ceremony before the giving the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: therefore that which was beſides this giving the Communion was no proper abſolution; it was not a prieſtly act indiſpenſably; it might be done by them that were no Prieſts: but the giving of the Communion, <hi>that</hi> was a ſacerdotal act, I mean
<pb n="632" facs="tcp:115796:343"/>the conſecration of it; though the tradition of it, was ſometimes by Deacons, ſometimes by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at home: This therefore was the diſpenſation of the keys; this was the effect of the powers of binding and looſing, of re mitting, or retaining ſins, according as the ſenſe and practice of the Church expounded her own power. The prayers of the Prieſt going before his miniſtration of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion were called <hi>abſolution;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſaac Lin. tit. 1 c. 16.</note> that is, the beginning, and one of the firſt portions of it: <hi>abſolutio Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotalium precum;</hi> ſo it was called in ancient Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels; the Prieſt impoſed hands, and prayed; and then gave the Communion. This was the ordinary way. But there was an extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>For in ſome caſes the impoſition of hands was omitted; that is, when the Biſhop or Prieſt was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and the Deacon prayed, or the Confeſſor: but this was <hi>firſt</hi> by the leave of the Biſhop or Prieſt, for to them it belong'd in ordinary. And 2. this was nothing elſe but a taking them from the ſtation of the penitents and a placing them amongſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful communicants; either by declaring that their penances were performed, or not to be exacted.</p>
                  <p>For by this we ſhall be clear of an objection which might ariſe from the caſe of dying penitents; to whom the Communion was given, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to the peace of the Church, that is, as they ſuppoſed, to Gods mercy and the pardon of ſins; for they would not chuſe to give the Communion to ſuch perſons whom they did not believe God had pardoned: but theſe perſons though communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
<note place="margin">Can. 78.</note> 
                     <hi>non tamen ſe credant abſolutos ſine manus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitione ſi ſupervixerint,</hi> were not to ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abſolved if they recovered that ſickneſſe without impoſition of hands; ſaid the Fathers of the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Councel of <hi>Carthage,</hi> by which it ſhould ſeem, abſolution was a thing diſtinct from giving the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</p>
                  <pb n="633" facs="tcp:115796:343"/>
                  <p>To this I anſwer,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="57"/> that the dying penitent was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſolved, in caſe he had receiv'd the firſt impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands for repentance, that is, if in his health he ſubmitted himſelf to penance, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick amends, and was prevented from finiſhing the impoſitions, they ſuppoſed that deſire and endevour of the penitent man was a worthy diſpoſition to the receiving the holy Communion and both together ſufficient for pardon, but becauſe this was only to be in the caſe of ſuch intervening neceſſity, and God will not accept of the will for the deed, but in ſuch caſes where the deed cannot be accompliſhed, therefore they bound ſuch penitents to return to their firſt obligation in caſe they ſhould recover, ſince God had taken off their neceſſity, and reſtored them to their firſt capacity. And by this we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of the third Canon of the firſt <hi>Arauſican</hi> Councel. <hi>They who having received pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance depart from the body, it pleaſes that they ſhall be communicated</hi> ſine reconciliatoriâ manus impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, <hi>without the reconciling impoſition of hands;</hi> that is, becauſe the penitential impoſition of hands was impoſed upon them, and they did what they could, though the laſt impoſition was not, though the laſt hand was not put upon them, declaring that they had done their penances, and compleated their ſatisfactions, yet they might be communicated, that is, abſolved; <hi>quod morientis ſufficit conſolationi, this is enough to the comfort of the dying man according to the definition of the Fathers who conveniently enough called ſuch a Communion their Viaticum, their Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port or proviſion for their way.</hi> For there were two ſolemn impoſitions of hands in repentance; The firſt and greateſt was in the firſt admiſſion of them and in the impoſition of the Diſciplne or manner of performing penances: and this was the Biſhops of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and of great conſideration amongſt the holy
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:115796:344"/>Primitives; and was never done but by the ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Clergy, as is evident in Eccleſiaſtical ſtory. The ſecond ſolemn impoſition of hands was immediatly before their abſolution or Communion; and it was a holy prayer and publication that he was accepted and had finiſhed that proceſſe: This was the leſſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn, and was ordinarily done by the ſuperiour Clergy; but ſometimes by others, as I have remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated: other intermedial impoſitions there were, as appears by the <hi>Creber recurſus</hi> mentioned in the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Councel of <hi>Toledo</hi> above cited; the penitents were often to beg the Biſhops pardon, or the Prieſts prayers, and the advocations and interceſſions of the faithful; but <hi>the peace of the Church,</hi> that is, that pardon which ſhe could miniſter, and which ſhe had a promiſe that God would confirm in heaven, was the Miniſtery of pardon in the diſpenſation of the Sacrament of <hi>that body</hi> that was broken, and <hi>that bloud</hi> that was powred forth for the remiſſion of our ſins.</p>
                  <p>The reſult is;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="58"/> That the <hi>abſolution</hi> of ſins which in the later forms and uſages of the Church is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, can be nothing but declarative; the office of the preacher and the guide of ſoules; of great uſe to timerous perſons, and to the greateſt peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, full of comfort, full of uſefulneſs, and inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; and therefore although this very <hi>declaration of pardon</hi> may truly and according to the ſtyle of Scripture be called <hi>pardon;</hi> and the power and office of pronouncing the penitents pardon is in the ſenſe of the Scripture and the Church, a good ſenſe and ſignification of power; as the Phariſees are ſaid <hi>to juſtifie God,</hi> when they declare his juſtice; and as the preacher that <hi>converts a ſinner</hi> is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>to ſave a ſoul from death;</hi> yet if we would ſpeak properly, and as things are in their own nature and inſtitution, this declarative abſolution is only an act of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:115796:344"/>or opening and reading the Commiſſion; an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Spirit of prudence and government en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon the Church; but the power of the keys is another thing; it is the diſpenſing all thoſe rites and miniſteries by which heaven is opened; and that is, the word and baptiſme <hi>at the firſt,</hi> and <hi>ever after</hi> the holy Sacrament of the ſupper of the Lord, and all the parts of the Biſhops and Prieſts advocation and interceſſion in holy prayers and offices.</p>
                  <p>But as for the <hi>declarative abſolution,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="59"/> although it is rather an act of wiſdom then of power, it being true as S. <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">In 16 Mat.</note> that as the Prieſts of the Law could only diſcern, and neither cauſe, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move leproſies: ſo the Miniſters of the Goſpel when they retain or remit ſins, do but in the one judge how long we continue guilty, and in the other declare when we are clear and free; yet this very declaration is of great uſe, and in many caſes of great effect. For as God did in the caſe of <hi>David</hi> give to the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> a particular ſpecial and extraordinary commiſſion: ſo to the Miniſters of the Goſpel he gives one that is ordinary and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. <hi>He</hi> had a prophetical evidence; but <hi>theſe</hi> have a certainty of faith as to one of the propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as to the other, ſome parts of humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to aſſure them 1. of <hi>Gods gracious pardon to the penitent,</hi> and 2. <hi>of the ſincerity of their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance:</hi> and therefore can with great effect miniſter to the comfort of ſad and afflicted penitents: This does declare the pardon upon obſervation of the juſt grounds and diſpoſitions; but the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Eccleſiaſtical Sacraments does really miniſter to it, not only by conſigning it; but as inſtruments of the Divine appointment to convey proper mercies to worthily diſpoſed perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="60"/> But the other great thing which I was to ſay in this article is this, That the judicial abſolution of
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:115796:345"/>the Prieſt does effect no material event or change in the penitent <hi>as to the giving the pardon,</hi> and therefore cannot be it which Chriſt intended in the giving thoſe excellent powers of remitting and retaining ſins. Now upon this will the whole iſſue depend. Does the prieſt abſolve him whom God condemnes? God is the ſupreme Judge, and though we may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to his judgement, yet we cannot contradict it; or can the Prieſt condemn him whom God abſolves? That alſo is impoſſible, <hi>He is neer that juſtifieth me, who will contend with me? and if God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> Or will not God pardon, unleſs the <hi>Prieſt</hi> abſolves us? That may become a ſad ſtory For he may be malicious, or ignorant, or intereſted, or covetous, and deſirous to ſerve his own ends upon the ruine of my ſoul, and therefore God diſpenſes his mercies by more regular, juſt and equal meaſures then the accidental ſentences of unknowing or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent men: If then the Prieſt miniſters only to repentance, by ſaying, <hi>I abſolve thee,</hi> what is it that he effects? For ſince Gods pardon does not go by his meaſures; his muſt go by Gods meaſures; and the effect of that will be this, God works his own work in us; and when his Miniſter obſerves the effects of the divine grace, he can and ought to publiſh and declare to all the purpoſes of comfort and inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that the perſon is abſolved; that is he is in the ſtate of grace and divine favour, in which if he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeveres he ſhall be ſaved. But all this while the work is ſuppoſed to be done before; and if it be, the Prieſt hath nothing left for him to do, but to approve, to warrant and to publiſh. And the caſe in ſhort is this.</p>
                  <p>Either the ſinner hath repented worthily,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="61"/> or he hath not. If he hath, then God hath pardoned him already, by vertue of all the promiſes Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical. If he hath not repented worthily, the Prieſt cannot, ought not to abſolve him; and therefore
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:115796:345"/>can by this abſolution effect no new thing. The work is done before the Prieſtly abſolution, and therefore cannot depend upon it. Againſt this, no ſect of men oppoſes any thing that I know of, excepting onely the Roman Doctors; who yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the argument of value, if the penitent be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite.</hi> But they adde this, that there is an imperfect <hi>Contrition,</hi> which by a diſtinct word they call <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition,</hi> which is a natural grief, or a grief proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly from fear or ſmart, and hath in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of love; and this they ſay does not juſtify the man, nor pardon the ſin of it ſelf. But if this man come to the Prieſt, and confeſs and be abſolv'd, that abſolution makes this attrition to become contrition, or w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is all one, it pardons the mans ſins; and though this imperfect penitent cannot hope for pardon upon the confidence of that indiſpoſition, yet by the Sacrament of penance, or Prieſtly abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he may hope it, and ſhall not be deceived.</p>
                  <p>Indeed if this were true,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="62"/> it were a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to ſome perſons who need it mightily. But they are the worſt ſort of penitents, and ſuch which though they have been very bad, yet now reſolve not to be very good, if they can any other way eſcape it; and by this means the Prieſts power is highly advanc'd, and to ſubmit to it, would be highly neceſſary to moſt men, and ſafeſt to all. But if this be not true, then to hope it, is a falſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and of danger to the event of ſouls; it is a nurſe of careleſneſs, and gives boldneſs to imperfect penitents, and makes them to ſlacken their own piety, becauſe they look for ſecurity upon confidence of that which will be had without trouble, or morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication; even the Prieſts abſolution. This there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I am to examine, as being of very great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the whole article of Repentance and promiſed to be conſidered in the beginning of this Paragraph.</p>

                  <head>§. 5. <hi>Attrition, or the imperfect repentance, though with abſolution, is not ſufficient.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>BY Attrition they mean the moſt imperfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="63"/> that is, a ſorrow proceeding from fear of hell, a ſorrow not mingled with the love of God: This ſorrow newly begun (they ſay) is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for pardon, if the ſins be confeſt, and the party abſolved by the Prieſt. This indeed is a ſhort pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and very eaſy, but if it be not effectual and valid, the perſons that rely upon it are miſerably un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done. Here therefore I conſider,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="64"/> Attrition being a word of the Schools, not of the Scripture, or of antiquity, means what they pleaſe to have it; and although they differ in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning its definition, yet it being the leaſt and the worſt part of repentance, every action of any man that can in any ſenſe be ſaid to repent upon conſideration of any the moſt affrighting threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings in the Goſpel, cannot be denied to have <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition.</hi> Now ſuch a perſon who being ſcar'd, comes to confeſs his ſin, may ſtill retain his affections to it; for nothing but love to God can take away his love from evil, and if there be love in it, it is <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> not <hi>Attrition.</hi> From theſe premiſes it follows, that if the Prieſt can abſolve him that is <hi>attrite,</hi> he may pardon him who hath affections to ſin ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; that is, one who fears hell, but does not love God. If it be ſaid that abſolution changes fear into love, attrition into contrition, a <hi>Saul</hi> into a <hi>David,</hi> a <hi>Judas</hi> into a <hi>John,</hi> a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> into
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:115796:346"/>
                     <hi>Simon Peter;</hi> then the greateſt converſions and miracles of change, may be wrought in an inſtant by an ordinary miniſtery; and when <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was affrighted by S. <hi>Peter</hi> about the horror of his ſin, and told that he was in the gall of bitterneſs, and thereupon deſired the Apoſtle to pray for him, if S. <hi>Peter</hi> had but abſolved him, which he certainly might upon that affright he put the Sorcerer in; he had made him a Saint preſently, and needed not to have ſpoken ſo uncertainly concerning him; <hi>Pray, if peradventure the thought of thy heart may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given thee.</hi> For without peradventure he might have made a quicker diſpatch, and a ſurer work, by giving him abſolution upon his preſent ſubmiſſion, and the deſire of his prayers, and his viſible appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent fear of being in the gall of bitterneſs, all which muſt needs be as much or more then the Roman Schools define Attrition to be. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="65"/> The Prieſt pardons upon no other terms then thoſe upon which God pardons; for if he does then he is not the miniſter of God, but the ſupreme lord, and muſt doe it by his own meaſures, if he does it not by the meaſures of God. For God does ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pardon him that is onely attrite; and this is confeſſed, in that they require the man to goe to the Prieſt, that he may be made contrite: which is all one, as if he were bidden to goe to the Prieſt to be made chaſt, or liberal, temperate or humble in an inſtant.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="66"/> And if it be ſaid, that although God does not pardon him that is attrite, unleſs it be together with the Keys, that is, unleſs the Prieſt abſolves him; but then, it being all that God requires in that caſe, the Prieſt does no more then God warrants; it is done by Gods meaſures; the attrition or imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of the penitent, and the Keys or the Church being all which God requires; this indeed if it
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:115796:347"/>could be proved were ſomething, but there is no tittle of it in Scripture or Antiquity; it being no where ſaid, that attrition and abſolution alone are ſufficient, and is an unreaſonable dream but of ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="67"/> For if attrition be good of it ſelf, and a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient diſpoſition to receive pardon from the Church, then it is alſo ſufficient to obtain pardon of God without the Church, <hi>in caſe of neceſsity.</hi> For unleſs it be for him in caſe of neceſſity ſufficient to deſire abſolution, then the outward act does more then the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the ceremony were more then the grace, and the Prieſt could doe more then God would; for the Prieſt would and could pardon him, whom God would not pardon without the Prieſt; and the will could not be accepted for the deed, when the deed were impoſſible to be done; and God would require of us more then we have, more then he hath given us; and a man ſhould live or die not by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but ſhould be judged by the actions of others. All which contain in them impoſſible affirmatives, and therefore proceed from a falſe principle.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="68"/> But then if Attrition in ſome caſes without the Sacrament were good, it is as good to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and purpoſes of pardon, as Contrition; for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition (ſay the Roman Schools) is not ſufficient of it ſelf without the Keys; that is, unleſs it contain in it a reſolution to confeſs and beg abſolution. Now this reſolution is no reſolution, unleſs it be reduced to act when it can; it is a mockery if it does not; and it is to be excuſed in no caſe, but in that of neceſſity. And juſt ſo it is in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, as I have proved. In vain therefore it is for any good man to perſwade his penitent to heighten his repentance, and to be contrite; for he may at a cheaper rate be aſſured of his pardon, if he makes
<pb n="641" facs="tcp:115796:347"/>the Prieſt his friend: but as for Contrition, by this doctrine, it is more then needs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="69"/> But then it is ſtrange, that Attrition which of it ſelf is inſufficient, ſhall yet do the work of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don with the Prieſts abſolution; and yet that that which is ſufficient (as Contrition is affirmed to be in the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi>) ſhall not doe it without abſolution, in act or deſire; that is in act always,
<note place="margin">Seſſ. 14. c. 4.</note> unleſs it be impoſſible: This incourages the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and diſcourages the perfect, tying them both to equal laws, whether they need it, or need it not.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="70"/> But I demand; Can the Prieſt hearing of a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent mans confeſſion, whom he juſtly and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out error perceives onely to be <hi>attrite,</hi> can he (I ſay) refuſe to abſolve him, can he retain his ſins, till he perceives him to be contrite? certainly in the Primitive Church when they deferr'd to give him the peace of the Church for 3, for 7, for 10, for 13 years together, their purpoſe then was to work in him <hi>contrition,</hi> or the moſt excellent Repentance. But however, if he can refuſe to abſolve ſuch a man, then it is becauſe abſolution will not work for him what is defective in him; it will not change it into contrition, for if it could, then to refuſe to abſolve him, were highly uncharitable and unreaſonable. But if he cannot refuſe to abſolve ſuch a perſon, it is becauſe he is ſufficiently diſpoſed, he hath done all that God requires of him to diſpoſe himſelf to it; and if ſo, then the Sacrament (as they call it) that is, the Prieſts abſolution does nothing to the increaſing his diſpoſition, it is ſufficient already. Adde to this, if in the caſe of attrition the Prieſt may not deny to abſolve the imperfect penitent, then it is certain God will abſolve him, in caſe the Prieſt does not; for if the Prieſt be bound and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to doe it, this ought not, it cannot prejudice
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:115796:348"/>the penitent, but himſelf onely. He therefore ſhall not periſh for want of the Prieſts abſolution; and if it could be otherwiſe, then the Pariſhioner might be damned for the Curates fault, which to affirm were certain blaſphemy and hereſy. What the Prieſt is bound to doe, God will doe, if the Prieſt will not. The reſult is this. That if this imperfect re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, which they call <hi>attrition,</hi> be a ſufficient diſpoſition to abſolution, then the Prieſts miniſtery is not operative for the making it ſufficient; and indeed it were ſtrange it ſhould, that abſolution ſhould make contrition, and yet contrition be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to abſolution; that the form ſhould make the matter, that one eſſential or integral part ſhould make another; that what is to be before, muſt be made by that which comes after. But if this attrition be not a ſufficient diſpoſition to abſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Prieſt may not abſolve ſuch imperfect penitents. So that the Prieſt cannot make it ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, if of it ſelf it be inſufficient; and if it be of it ſelf ſufficient, then his abſolution does but declare it ſo, it effects it not.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="71"/> And after all, it is certain that the words of abſolution effect no more then they ſignifie. If therefore they doe pardon the ſin, yet they doe not naturally change the diſpoſition or the real habit of the ſinner. And if the words can effect more, they may be changed to ſignify what they doe effect; for to ſignify is leſs then to effect. Can therefore the Church uſe this form of abſolution? <hi>I doe by the power committed unto me, change thy attrition into contrition.</hi> The anſwer to this is not yet made; for their pretence is ſo new, and ſo wholly unexamined, that they have not yet conſidered any thing of it. It will therefore ſuffice for our inſtitution in this uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, material and practical queſtion, that no ſuch words were inſtituted by Chriſt, nor any thing like
<pb n="643" facs="tcp:115796:348"/>them; no ſuch were uſed by the Primitive Church, no ſuch power pretended. And as this new do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Roman Church contains in it huge eſtrangements, and diſtances from the ſpirit of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is another kinde of thing then the doctrine and practice of the Apoſtolical and ſucceeding ages of the Church did publiſh or exerciſe: ſo it is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect deſtruction to the neceſſity of holy life, it is a device onely to advance the Prieſts office, and to depreſs the neceſſity of holy diſpoſitions; it is a trick to make the graces of Gods holy Spirit to be bought and ſold; and that a man may at a price be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come holy in an inſtant, juſt as if a Teacher of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick ſhould undertake to convey skill to his Scholar, and ſell the art and tranſmit it in an hour; it is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to make diſpoſitions by art and in effect requires little or nothing of duty to God, ſo they pay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Prieſt. But I ſhall need to oppoſe no more againſt it, but thoſe excellent words, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meditation of <hi>Salvian. Non levi agendum eſt contritione, ut debita illa redimantur quibus mors aeterna debetur, nec tranſitoriâ opus eſt ſatisfactione pro malis illis propter quae paratus eſt ignis aeternus.</hi> It is not a light contrition, by which thoſe debts can be redeem'd to which eternal death is due; neither can a tranſitory ſatisfaction ſerve for thoſe evils, for which God hath prepared the vengeance of eternal fire.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IN the Primitive Church,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="72"/> the word <hi>Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> was the whole word for all the parts and exerciſes of repentance; according to thoſe words of <hi>Lactantius, Poenitentiam propoſuit, ut ſi peccata noſtra confeſſi Deo ſatisfecerimus, veniam conſequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</hi> He propounded repentance, that if we confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing our ſins to God, make amends or ſatisfaction, we may obtain pardon. Where it is evident, that <hi>Satisfaction</hi> does not ſignify in the modern ſenſe of the word, a full payment to the Divine Juſtice; but by the exerciſes of repentance a deprecation of our fault, and a begging pardon. Satisfaction and pardon are not conſiſtent, if ſatisfaction ſignify rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly. When the whole debt is paid, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be forgiven. The Biſhops and Prieſts in the Primitive Church would never give pardon till their ſatisfactions were performed. To confeſs their ſins, to be ſorrowful for them, to expreſs their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to puniſh the guilty perſon, to doe actions contrary to their former ſins, this was their amends or <hi>Satisfaction;</hi> and this ought to be ours.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Exomologeſis,</hi> or <hi>Confeſſion</hi> was the word which (as I noted formerly) was of moſt frequent uſe in the Church. <hi>Si de exomologeſi retractas, gehennam in corde conſidera quam tibi exomologeſis extinguet.</hi> He that retracts his ſins by confeſſing and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, extinguiſhes the flames of hell.

                  <p>Things being thus,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="73"/> we need not immerge our ſelves in the trifling controverſies of our later Schools, about the juſt value of every work, and how much every penance weighs, and whether God is ſo ſatisfied with our penal works, that in juſtice he muſt take off ſo much as we put on, and is tied alſo to take our accounts. Certain it is, if God ſhould weigh our ſins with the ſame value as we weigh our own good works, all our actions and ſufferings would be found infinitely too light in the ballance. Therefore it were better that we ſhould doe what we can, and humbly begge of God to weigh them both with vaſt allowances of mercy. All that we can doe, is to be ſorrowful for our ſins, and to leave them,
<note place="margin">Tertul. de poenit.</note> and to endevour to obey God in the time to follow; and to take care, <hi>ut aliquo actu adminiſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur poenitentia,</hi> that our repentance be exerciſed with certain acts proper to it.

                  <p>76. But the uſe of this is material; It is a direct <hi>judging of our ſelves,</hi> and a perverting the wrath of God; not that theſe penances are a paiment for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of the temporal guilt, remaining after the ſin is pardoned. That's but a dream, for the guilt and the puniſhment are not to be diſtinguiſhed in any material event: ſo long as a man is liable to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="649" facs="tcp:115796:351"/>ſo long he is guilty: and ſo long he is unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, as he is obnoxious to the Divine anger. God cannot, will not puniſh him that is innocent; and he that is wholly pardoned, is in the place and ſtate of a guiltleſſe perſon. Indeed God puniſhes as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and pardons as he pleaſes, by parts, and as he is appeaſed, or as he inclines to mercy; but our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meaſure is, <hi>As our repentance is, ſo is our pardon,</hi> and every action of repentance does ſomething of help to us, and this of ſelf-affliction, when it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a hearty deteſtation of ſin, and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt our ſelves for having provoked God, is a very good exerciſe of repentance; of it ſelf it profits little, but as it is a fruit of repentance, in the vertue of it it is accepted towards its part of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piation, and they that have refuſed this, have felt worſe;
<q>Et qui non tulerat verbera, tela tulit.</q> But when God ſees us ſmite our ſelves in indignation for our ſins, becauſe we have no better way to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe and act our repentances, God hath accepted it, and hath himſelf forborn to ſmite us, and we have reaſon to beleeve he will do ſo again. For theſe expreſſions extinguiſh the delicacies of the fleſh, from whence our ſins have too often had their ſpring: and when the offending party accuſes himſelf firſt, and ſmites firſt, and calls for pardon, there is nothing left to the offended perſon to do, but to pity and pardon. For we ſee that ſometimes God ſmites a ſinner with a temporal curſe, and brings the man to repentance, and pardons all the reſt; and therefore much rather will he do it, when we ſmite our ſelves. For this is the higheſt proceſſe of confeſſion. God is pleaſed that we are aſhamed of our ſin, that we juſtifie God, and give ſentence againſt our ſelves, that we accuſe our ſelves and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:115796:352"/>our ſelves worthy of his ſevereſt wrath: If therefore we go on and puniſh the ſinner too, it is all, it is the greateſt thing we can do: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be not neceſſary in any one inſtance to be done, unleſſe where the authority of our ſuperiour does intervene; yet it is accepted in every inſtance, if the principle be good, that is, if it proceeds from our indignation againſt ſin, and if it be not reſted in as a thing of it ſelf, and ſingly a ſervice of God, which indeed he hath no where in particular required; and laſtly, if it be done prudently and temperately. If theſe cautions be obſerved in all things elſe, it is true that <hi>the moſt laborious repentance,</hi> if other things be anſwerable, <hi>is the beſt,</hi> for <hi>it takes off the ſoftneſſe of the fleſh, and the tenderneſſe of the lower man, it abates the love of the world, &amp; enkindles the love of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, it is ever the beſt token of ſincerity and an humble repentance, and does promote it too, ſtill in better de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees effecting what it doth ſignifie.</hi> As muſick in a banquet of wine, and careſſes <hi>and indications of joy</hi> and feſtivity are ſeaſonable and proper expreſſions at a <hi>ſolemnity of joy:</hi> ſo are all the ſad accents and circumſtances, and effects and inſtruments of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row proper in a day of mourning. All nations weep not in the ſame manner, and have not the ſame interjections of ſorrow: but as every one of us uſe to mourn in our greateſt loſſes, and in the death of our deareſt relatives, ſo it is fit we ſhould mourn in the dangers and death of our ſouls; that they may being refreſhed by ſuch ſalutary and medicinal ſhowers ſpring up to life eternal.</p>
                  <p>77. In the ſeveral ages of the Church they had ſeveral methods of theſe ſatisfactions; and they requiring a longer proof of their repentance then we uſually do, did alſo by conſequent injoyn and expect greater and longer penitential ſeverities: Concerning which theſe two things are certain.</p>
                  <pb n="651" facs="tcp:115796:352"/>
                  <p>78. <hi>The one is,</hi> that they did not believe them ſimply neceſſary to the procuring of pardon from God; which appears in this, that they did abſolve perſons in the article of death, though they had not done their ſatisfactions. They would abſolve none that did not expreſs his repentance ſome way or other; but they did abſolve them that could doe no exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour penances, by which it is plain that they made a ſeparation of that which was <hi>uſeful</hi> and <hi>profitable</hi> only from that which is <hi>neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>79. <hi>The other thing which I was to ſay is this.</hi> That though theſe corporal ſeverities were not eſteemed by them ſimply neceſſary, but ſuch which might in any and in every inſtance be omitted in ordinary caſes, and commuted for others more fit and uſeful; yet they choſe theſe auſterities as the <hi>beſt ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their repentance towards men,</hi> ſuch in which <hi>there is the greateſt likelyhood of ſincerity and a hearty ſorrow,</hi> ſuch which have in them the <hi>leaſt objection,</hi> ſuch in which a man hath the <hi>cleareſt power</hi> and <hi>the moſt frequent opportunity,</hi> ſuch which <hi>every man</hi> can do, which have in them <hi>the leaſt inlet to temptation,</hi> and the <hi>leaſt powers to abuſe a man;</hi> and they are ſuch which do not only <hi>ſignifie,</hi> but <hi>effect and promote repentance.</hi> But yet they are acts of repentance, juſt as beating the breaſts, or ſmiting the thigh, or ſighing, or tears, or tearing the hair, or refuſing our meat, are acts of ſorrow: if God ſhould command us to be ſorrowful, this might be done (when it could be done at all) though none of theſe were in the expreſſion and ſignification. The Jewes did in all great ſorrows or trouble of minde rent their garments. As we may be as much troubled as they, though we do not tear our clothes, ſo we may be as true penitents as were the holy Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitives, though we do not uſe that <gap reason="foreign">

The ſecond is ſerved by future obedience, by prayer, and by hope of pardon; and the laſt by alms and forgiveneſs: and we have no liberty or choyce but in the exerciſe of the penal or punitive part of repentance: but in that every man is left to himſelf, and hath no neceſſity upon him, unleſs where he hath firſt ſubmitted to a ſpiritual guide; or is noted publickly by the Church. But if our ſorrow be ſo trifling, or our ſins ſo ſlightly hated, or our fleſh ſo tender, or our ſenſuality ſo unmortified, that we will endure nothing of exteriour ſeverity to mortify our ſin, or to puniſh it, to prevent Gods anger, or to allay it; we may chance to feel the load of our ſins in temporal judgements, and have cauſe to ſuſpect the ſincerity of our repentance, and conſequently to fear the eternal.

No man repents but he that fears ſome evil to ſtand at the end of his evil courſe; and whoever feareth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he be abuſed by ſome collateral falſe perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, will be troubled for putting himſelf into ſo evil a condition and ſtate of things: and not to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with ſad apprehenſions, is nothing elſe but not to have conſidered, or to have promiſed to himſelf pardon upon eaſier conditions then God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.

<pb n="661" facs="tcp:115796:357"/>it is an unſpeakable horror, for a man eternally to be reſtleſs in the vexations of an everlaſting fever, and that <hi>ſuch a fever</hi> is as much ſhort of the eternal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God, as a <hi>ſingle ſigh</hi> is of <hi>that fever;</hi> that a man cannot think what <hi>eternity</hi> is, nor ſuffer with patience for <hi>one minute</hi> the pains which are provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for <hi>that eternity;</hi> and to apply all this to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for ought every great ſinner knows, this ſhall be in his lot; and if he dies before his ſin is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd, he is too ſure it ſhall be ſo: and whether his ſin is pardon'd or no, few men ever know till they be dead; but very many men preſume, and they commonly, who have the leaſt reaſon. He that often and long conſiders theſe things, will not have cauſe to complain of too merry a heart: But when men repent onely in feaſts, and company, and open houſe, and careleſneſs, and inconſideration, they will have cauſe to repent that he hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented.</p>

<pb n="663" facs="tcp:115796:358"/>No man tels it as a merry ſtory that he once broke his leg; or laughs when he recounts the ſad groans and intolerable ſharpneſſes of the ſtone. If there be pleaſure in the telling it, there is ſtill remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too much kindneſs towards it, and then the ſinner cannot juſtly pretend that ever he was a hearty enemy to it: for the great effect of that is <hi>to hate it; to leave it, and to hate it.</hi> Indeed when the penitent inquires concerning himſelf, and looks after a ſign that he may diſcern whether he be as he thinks he is, really <hi>a hater of ſin;</hi> the greateſt and moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible mark which we have to judge by, is, the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing it utterly.

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> but doe not hate it; They will not doe it, but they wiſh it were lawful to do it; and this, although it hath in it a great imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet it is not always directly criminal; for it onely ſuppoſes a love to the natural part of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and a hatred of the irregularity. The <hi>thing they love,</hi> but they <hi>hate the ſin</hi> of it. But others are not ſo innocent in their leaving of ſin; They leave it, becauſe they dare not doe it, or are reſtrain'd by ſome over-ruling accident; but like the heifers that drew the Ark, they went lowing after their Calves left in their ſtals; ſo doe theſe, leave their heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and if they ſtill love the ſin, their leaving it, is but an imperfect and unacceptable ſervice, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice without a heart. Therefore ſin muſt be ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted too, that is, it muſt be left out of hatred to it; and conſequently muſt be uſed as naturally we doe what we doe really hate: that is, do evil to it, and always ſpeak evil of it, and ſecretly have no kindneſs for it.</p>

If we obſerve ſtrictly we ſhall prevent ſome, but we ſhall obſerve too many to preſs us; If we obſerve not, they will multiply without notice and without number. But in either caſe it will be impoſſible to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to every one of them with a ſpecial laſting ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and yet one act of ſorrow is too little for any one choſen ſin (as I have proved formerly.) In this caſe when we have prayed for pardon of each, confeſs'd it, acknowledged the folly of it, depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the puniſhment, ſuffer'd the ſhame, and endur'd the ſorrow, and begg'd for aids againſt it, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed our force; it will fall into the heap of the ſtate and generality of repentance; that is, it will be added to the portentous number of follies, for which in general and indefinite comprehenſions we muſt beg for pardon humbly and earneſtly all the days of our life. And I have no caution to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded here, but this onely: <hi>viz.</hi> That we be not too haſty to put it into the general heap, but according to the greatneſs, or the danger, or its miſchief, or its approach towards a habit, ſo it is to be kept in fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by it ſelf alone.

                  <p n="11">11. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="12"/> It is a great matter, that in our inquiries concerning our penitential ſorrow, we be able to diſcern what is the preſent motive and incentive of it: whether fear or love, whether it be <hi>attrition</hi> or <hi>contrition.</hi> For by this we can tell beſt in what ſtate or period of pardon we ſtand. I doe not ſay, we are to enquire what motive began our ſorrow: for <hi>fear</hi> begins moſt commonly; but we are to regard
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:115796:360"/>what is the preſent inducement, what continues the hatred; that is, whither our firſt fears have born us?

The reaſon is, becauſe what proceeds from an intolerable and a violent cauſe, as repentance in ſickneſs and danger of death, or in the day of our calamity does; is of it ſelf for the preſent defective in a main part, and cannot arrive at pardon, till the love of God be in it: ſo Chriſt ſaid of <hi>Mary Magdalon; Much hath been forgiven her, becauſe ſhe loved much;</hi> but from a great <hi>fear</hi> to paſs into <hi>love</hi> is a work of time, the effect of a long progreſſion in repentance, and is not eaſy to be done in thoſe ſtraitneſſes of time and grace, which is part of the evil portion of dying ſinners.

                  <p n="15">15. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> He that confeſſeth his ſins, muſt doe it with all ſincerity and ſimplicity of ſpirit, not to ſerve ends, or to make Religion the miniſter of deſign; but to deſtroy our ſin, to ſhame and puniſh our ſelves, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain pardon, and inſtitution; always telling our ſad ſtory juſt as it was in its acting, excepting where the manner of it and its nature or circumſtances require a vail; and then the ſin muſt not be concealed, nor yet ſo repreſented as to keep the firſt immodeſty alive in him that acted it, or to become a new tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation in him that hears it. But this laſt caution is onely of uſe in our confeſſions to the Miniſter of holy things; for our confeſſion to God as it is to other purpoſes, ſo muſt be in other manners: but I have already given accounts of this. I onely adde, that</p>
                  <p n="16">16. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> All our confeſſions muſt be accuſations of our ſelves, and not of others. For if we confeſs to God, then to accuſe another may ſpoil our own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:115796:362"/>but it can ſerve no end; for God already knows all that we can ſay to leſſen, or to aggravate the ſin: if we confeſs to men, then to name another, or by any way to ſignify or reveal him, is a direct defamation; and unleſs <hi>the naming of the ſin</hi> do of it ſelf declare the aſſiſting party, it is at no hand to be done, or to be inquired into: But if a man hath committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt, and there is but one perſon in the world with whom he could commit it; in this caſe the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his ſin, does accuſe another; but then ſuch a Guide of ſouls is to be choſen to whom that perſon is not known; but if by this or ſome other expedient the ſame of others be not ſecured, it is beſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that thing to God onely, and ſo much of the ſin as may aggravate it to an equal height with its own kinde in ſpecial, may be communicated to him of whom we ask comfort, and counſel and inſtitution. If to confeſs to a Prieſt were a Divine Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this caution would have in it ſome difficulty, and much variety; but ſince the practice is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us wholly upon the ſtock of prudence, and great charity; the doing it, ought not in any ſenſe to be uncharitable to others.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> He that hath injur'd his neighbour muſt <hi>confeſs to him;</hi> and he that hath ſinn'd againſt the Church, muſt make amends and <hi>confeſs to the Church,</hi> when ſhe declares her ſelf to be offended. For when a fact is done which cannot naturally be undone, the onely duty that can remain is to reſcind it morally, and make it not to be any longer or any more. For as our converſation is a continual creation, ſo is the perpetuating of a ſin a continuation of its being and actings, and therefore to ceaſe from it, is the death of the ſin for the preſent and for the future; but to confeſs it, to hate it, to wiſh it had never been done, is all the poſſibility that is left to annihilate the act which <hi>naturally</hi> can never be undone; and therefore
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:115796:363"/>to all perſons that are injur'd, to confeſs the ſin, muſt needs be a duty, becauſe it is the firſt part of amends, and ſometimes all that is left; but it is that which God and man requires, before they are willing to pardon the offender. For until the erring man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, it does not appear who is innocent, and who is guilty, or whether the offended perſon have any thing to forgive.

                  <p n="18">18. Let no man think it a ſhame to confeſs his ſin; or if he does, yet let not that ſhame deter him from it. There is indeed a ſhame in confeſſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>nakedneſs</hi> is diſcovered; but there is alſo a glory in it, becauſe there is <hi>a cure</hi> too: there is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> and <hi>amendment.</hi> This advice is like that which is given to perſons giving their lives in a good cauſe, requiring them not to be afraid; that is, not to ſuffer ſuch a fear, as to be hindred from dying. For if they ſuffer a great natural fear, and yet in deſpite of that fear die conſtantly and patiently, that fear as it increaſes their ſuffering, may alſo acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally increaſe their glory, provided that the fear be not criminal in its cauſe, nor effective of any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy comportment. So is the ſhame in confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; a great mortification of the man, and highly punitive of the ſin; and ſuch that unleſs it hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the duty, is not to be directly reproved: but it muſt be taken care of that it be a ſhame onely for the ſin, which by how much greater it is, by ſo much the more earneſtly the man ought to fly to all the means of remedy and inſtruments of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and then the greater the ſhame is which the ſinner ſuffers, the more excellent is the repentance which ſuffers ſo much for the extinction of his ſin. But at no hand let the ſhame affright the duty; but let it be remembred, that this confeſſion is but the memory of the ſhame, which began when the ſin was acted, and abode but as a handmaid of the guilt and goes away with it: Confeſſion of ſins opens them to man, but draws a vail before them, that God will the leſs behold them. And it is a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial conſideration, that if a man be impatient of the ſhame here, when it is revealed but to one man, who is alſo by all the ties of Religion &amp; by common Honeſty oblig'd to conceal them; or if he account it intolerable that a ſin publick in the <hi>ſcandal</hi> and
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:115796:364"/>the <hi>infamy,</hi> ſhould be made publick by <hi>ſolemnity</hi> to puniſh and to extinguiſh it, the man will be no gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by refuſing to confeſs, when he ſhall remember that ſins unconfeſſed are moſt commonly unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd; and unpardon'd ſins will be made publick before all Angels, and all the wiſe and good men of the world, when their ſhame ſhall have nothing to make it tolerable.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="20"/> When a penitent confeſſes his ſin, the holy man that miniſters to his Repentance, and hears his Confeſſion, muſt not without great cauſe leſſen the ſhame of the repenting man; he muſt directly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the duty, but not adde confidence to the ſinner. For whatſoever directly leſſens the ſhame, leſſens alſo the hatred of ſin, and his future caution, and the reward of his repentance; and takes off that which was an excellent defenſative againſt the ſin. But with the ſhame, the Miniſter of Religion is to doe as he is to doe with the mans ſorrow: ſo long as it is a good inſtrument of repentance, ſo long it is to be permitted and aſſiſted, but when it becomes irregular, or diſpos'd to evil events, it is to be taken off. And ſo muſt the ſhame of the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent man; when there is danger, leſt the man be ſwallowed up by too much ſorrow and ſhame, or when it is perceiv'd, that the ſhame alone is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the duty. In theſe caſes, if the penitent man can be perſwaded directly and by choice, for ends of piety and religion to ſuffer the ſhame, then let his ſpirit be ſupported by other means; but if he cannot, let there be ſuch a confidence wrought in him, which is deriv'd from the circumſtances of the perſon, or the univerſal calamity and iniquity of man, or the example of great ſinners like himſelf, that have willingly undergone the yoke of the Lord, or from conſideration of the divine mercies, or from the eaſineſs and advantages of the duty, but
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:115796:364"/>let nothing be offer'd to leſſen the hatred, or the greatneſs of the ſin; leſt a temptation to ſin <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,</hi> be ſowed in the furrows of the <hi>preſent</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> He that confeſſeth his ſins to the Miniſter of Religion, muſt be ſure to expreſs all the great lines of his folly and calamity; that is, all that by which he may make a competent judgement of the ſtate of his ſoul Now if the man be of a good life, and yet in his tendency to perfection, is willing to paſs under the method and diſcipline of greater ſinners, there is no advice to be given to him, but that he doe not curiouſly tell thoſe leſſer irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which vex his peace, rather then diſcompoſe his conſcience: but what is moſt remarkable in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, or the whole ſtate, and the greateſt marks and inſtances, and returns of them he ought to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, for elſe he can ſerve no prudent end in his confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> if the man have committed a great ſin, it is a high prudence, and an excellent inſtance of his repentance, that he confeſs it, declaring the kinde of it, if it be of that nature that the ſpiritual man may conceal it. But if upon any other account he be bound to reveal every notice of the fact, let him tranſact that affair wholly between God and his own ſoul. And this of declaring a ſingle action as it is of great uſe in the repentance of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, ſo it puts on ſome degrees of neceſſity, if the man be of a ſad, amazed and an afflicted conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. For there are ſome unfortunate perſons who have committed ſome ſecret facts of ſhame and hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, at the remembrance of which they are amazed, of the pardon of which they have no ſigne, for the expiation of which they uſe no inſtrument, and they walk up and down like diſtracted perſons, to whom reaſon is uſeleſs, and company is unpleaſant, and
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:115796:365"/>their ſorrow is not holy, but very great, and they know not what to doe, becauſe they wil not ask. I have obſerved ſome ſuch; and the onely remedy that was fit to be preſcribed to ſuch perſons, was to reveal their ſin to a ſpiritual man, and by him to be put into ſuch a ſtate of remedy and comfort as is proper for their condition. It is certain that many perſons have periſhed for want of counſel and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, which were ready for them if they would have confeſſed their ſin; for he that concealeth his ſin, <hi>non dirigetur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, he ſhall not be counſelled</hi> or <hi>directed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is a very great fault amongſt a very great part of Chriſtians,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> that in their inquiries of Religion, even the beſt of them, ordinarily ask but theſe two queſtions: <hi>Is it lawful? Is it neceſſary?</hi> If they finde it lawful, they will do it without ſcruple or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint; and then they ſuffer imperfection, or receive the reward of folly. For it may be lawful, and yet not fit to be done. It may be it is not expedient. And he that will doe all that he can doe lawfully, would, if he durſt, do ſomething that is not lawful. And as great an error is on the other hand in the other queſtion. He that too ſtrictly inquires of an action whether it be neceſſary or no, would do well to ask alſo whether it be good? whether it be of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the intereſt of his ſoul? For if a Chriſtian man or woman; that is, a redeemed, bleſſed, obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged perſon, a great beneficiary, endeared to God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the comprehenſions of a mans imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, one that is leſs then the leaſt of all Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and yet hath received many great ones and hopes for more, if he ſhould doe nothing but what is neceſſary, that is, nothing but what he is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd to; then he hath the obligations of a ſon, and the affections of a ſlave, which is the greateſt undecency of the world in the accounts of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:115796:365"/>If a Chriſtian will doe no more then what is neceſſary, he will quickly be tempted to omit ſomething of that alſo. And it is highly conſiderable that in the matter of ſouls, <hi>Neceſſity</hi> is a diviſible word, and that which <hi>in diſputation</hi> is not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> may be <hi>neceſſary in practiſe:</hi> it may be but charity to one and duty to another, that is, when it is not <hi>a neceſſary duty,</hi> it may be <hi>a neceſſary charity.</hi> And therefore it were much the better if every man without further inquiry would in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of his ſoul conſult a ſpiritual Guide, and whether it be neceſſary or no, yet let him doe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is good; and even they who will not for Gods ſake doe that which is ſimply the beſt, yet for their own ſakes they will, or ought to doe that which is profitable, and of great advantage. Let men doe that which is beſt to themſelves; for it is all one to God, ſave onely that he is pleas'd to take ſuch inſtances of duty and forwardneſs of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, as the beſt ſignifications of the beſt love. And of this nature is <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of ſins to a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Religion,</hi> it is one of the moſt charitable works in the world to our ſelves; and in this ſenſe we may uſe the words of David, <hi>If thou doeſt well unto thy ſelf, men</hi> [&amp; God] <hi>will ſpeak good of thee,</hi> and do good to thee. He that will do <hi>every thing</hi> that is <hi>lawful,</hi> and <hi>nothing but what is neceſſary,</hi> will be an enemy when he dares, and a friend when he cannot help it.</p>
                  <p>But if the penitent perſon hath been an habitual ſinner,
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> in his confeſſions he is to take care that the Miniſter of Religion underſtand the degrees of his wickedneſſe, the time of his abode in ſin, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his deſires, the frequency of his acting them, not told <hi>by numbers,</hi> but by <hi>generall ſignifications</hi> of the <hi>time,</hi> and particular ſignifications of the <hi>earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his choice.</hi> For this tranſaction being wholly
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:115796:366"/>in order to the benefit and conduct of his ſoule, the good man that miniſters muſt have as perfect moral accounts as he can, but he is not to be reckon'd withal by natural numbers and meaſures, ſave only ſo far as they may declare the violence of defires, &amp; the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and choice of the ſin. The purpoſe of this advice is this; that ſince the tranſaction of this affaire is for counſel and comfort, in order to pardon, and the perfections of repentance, there ſhould be no ſcruple in the particular circumſtances of; but that it be done <hi>heartily</hi> and <hi>wiſely;</hi> that is, ſo as may beſt ſerve the ends to which it is deſigned; and that no man do it in deſpite of himſelf, or againſt his will for the thing it ſelf is not a direct ſervice of God immediatly enjoin'd, but is a ſervice to our ſelves to enable us to do our duty to God, and to receive a more ready and eaſie and certain pardon from him. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who pretend it as a neceſſary duty, have by affixing rules and meaſures to it of their own made that which they call neceſſary, to be intolerable and impoſſible. Indeed it is certain that when God hath appointed a duty, he alſo will deſcribe the meaſures, or elſe leave us to the conduct of our own choice and reaſon in it. But where God hath not deſcribed the meaſures, we are to do that which is moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the analogy of the commandement, or the principal duty, in caſe it be under a command: but if it be not, then we are onely to chooſe the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars ſo as may beſt miniſter to the end which is deſigned in the whole miniſtration.</p>
                  <p n="21">21. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="25"/> It is a very pious preparation to the holy Sacrament, that we confeſs our ſins to the Miniſter of Religion: for ſince it is neceſſary that a man be examined, and a ſelf-examination was preſcrib'd to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the time of their lapſed diſcipline, that though there were diviſions amongſt them, and no eſtabliſhed Governours, yet from this duty they
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:115796:366"/>were not to be excus'd, and they muſt in deſtitution of a publick Miniſter doe it themſelves (but this is in caſe onely of ſuch neceſſity) the other is better; that is, it is of better order, and more advantage that this part of Repentance and holy preparation be perform'd under the conduct of a Spiritual Guide. And the reaſon is preſſing. For ſince it is life or death that is there adminiſtred, and the great diſpenſation of the keyes is in that Miniſtery, it were very well if he that miniſters did know whether the perſon preſented were fit to communicate or no; and if he be not, it is charity to reject him, and charity to aſſiſt him that he may be fitted. There are many ſad contingencies in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Eccleſiaſtical affairs, in which every man that needs this help, and would fain make uſe of it, cannot; but when he can meet with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, it were well it were more frequently uſed, and more readily entertain'd. I end theſe advices, with the words of <hi>Origen:
<note place="margin">In Pſa. 36. hom. 1.</note> Extra veniam eſt qui pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum cognovit, nec cognitum confitetur.

He ſhall have no pardon, who knows his ſin and confeſſes it not: But we muſt confeſs alwayes, not that the ſin alwayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that of an old ſin an unwearied confeſſion is uſeful and profitable.</hi> But this is to be underſtand of a general accuſation, or of a confeſſion to God. For in confeſſions to men, there is no other uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of repeating our confeſſions, excepting where ſuch repetition does aggravate the fault of relapſing and ingratitude, in caſe the man returns to thoſe ſins for which he hop'd that <hi>before</hi> he did receive a pardon.</p>

Onely ſometimes they need caution for the degrees. Therefore</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/> Let the penitent be careful that he doe not injure his health, or oppreſs his ſpirit, by the zeal of this part of repentance. <hi>Sic enim peccata com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſcenda ſunt, ut ſuperſint quos peccaſſe poeniteat.</hi> For all ſuch fierce proceedings are either ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or deſperate, or indiſcreet, or the effect of a falſe perſwaſion concerning them; <hi>that they are a direct ſervice of God, that they are ſimply neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, and ſeverely enjoyn'd.</hi> All which are to be reſcinded, or elſe the penances will be of more hurt then uſefulneſs. Thoſe actions are to miniſter to repentance; and therefore if they contradict any duty, they deſtroy what they pretend to ſerve. For penances as they relate to the ſin that is committed, is juſt to be meaſured as peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiall ſorrow is, of which it is a ſignification and expreſſion. When the ſorrow is naturall, ſenſitive, pungent, and materiall, the penances
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:115796:367"/>will be ſo too. A great ſorrow refuſes to eat, to ſleep, to be chearful, to be in company, according as the degree is, and as the circumſtances of the perſons are. But ſometimes ſorrow is to be choſen, and invited by arts, and miniſtred to by external in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and arguments of invitation; and juſt ſo are the penances, they are then to be choſen, ſo as may make the perſon a ſorrowful mourner, to make him take no delight in ſin, but to conceive, and to feel a juſt diſpleaſure: For if men feel no ſmart, no real ſorrow or pain for their ſins, they will be too much in love with it: impunity is <gap reason="foreign">

<q>Non unquam reputant quantum ſibi gandia conſtant,</q> reckon their pleaſures, but never put any ſmart, or danger, or fears, or ſorrows into the ballance. But the injunction or ſuſception of penances is a good inſtrument of repentance, becauſe a little evil takes off the pleaſure of the biggeſt ſin in many inſtances, and we are too apprehenſive of the preſent, that this alſo becomes a great advantage to this mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery: we refuſe great and infinite pleaſures <hi>hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> ſo we may enjoy little, and few, and inconſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ones <hi>at preſent;</hi> and we fear not the horrible pains of hell, ſo we may avoid a little trouble in our perſons, or our intereſt. Therefore it is to be ſuppoſed, that this way of undertaking a preſent puniſhment and ſmart for our ſins (unleſs every thing when it becomes religious is deſpoyl'd of all its powers which it had in nature, and what is reaſon here, is not reaſon there) will be of great effect and power againſt ſin, and be an excellent <hi>inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of repentance.</hi> But it muſt be <hi>ſo much,</hi> and
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:115796:368"/>it muſt be <hi>no more;</hi> for penances are like fire and water, good ſo long as they are made to ſerve our needs; but when they go beyond that, <hi>they are not to be endured.</hi> For ſince God in the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of his anger does not puniſh one ſin with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let not us do worſe to our ſelves then the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt wrath of God in this world will inflict upon us.

Indeed it may happen that one ſin may cauſe or procure another, not by the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of God, or any direct action of his: but 1. withdrawing thoſe aſſiſtances which would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd a ſinful progreſſion. 2. By ſuffering him to fall into evil temptation, which is too hard for him conſiſting in his preſent voluntary indiſpoſition. 3. By the nature of ſin it ſelf, which may either <hi rend="sup">1</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a ſin by accident; as a great anger may by the withdrawing Gods reſtraining grace be permitted to paſs to an act of murder; or <hi rend="sup">2</hi> it may diſpoſe to others of like nature, as one degree of luſt brings in another; or <hi rend="sup">3</hi> it may miniſter matter of fuel to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin, as intemperance to uncleanneſs: or <hi rend="sup">4</hi> on
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:115796:368"/>ſin may be the end of another, as covetouſneſs may be the ſervant of luxury. In all theſe ways, one ſin may be effected by another; but in all theſe, God is onely conniving, or at moſt, takes off ſome of thoſe helps which the man hath forfeited, and God was not obliged to continue. Thus God hardned <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi> heart, even by way of object and occaſion; God hardned him, by ſhewing him a mercy, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off his fears when he remov'd the judgement; and God miniſtred to him ſome hope that it be ſo ſtill. But God does not inflict the ſin: The mans own impious hands do that, not becauſe he cannot help it, but becauſe he chooſes and delights in it. * Now if God in juſtice to us will not puniſh one ſin directly by another: let not us in our peniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial inflictions commit a ſin in indignation againſt our ſin; for that is juſt as if a man out of impatience of pain in his ſide, ſhould daſh his head againſt a wall.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> But if God pleaſes to inflict a puniſhment, let us be careful to exchange it into a penance, by kiſſing the rod, and entertaining the iſſues of the Divine juſtice by approbation of Gods proceeding, and confeſſion of our demerit and juſtification of God. It was a pretty accident and mixture of providence and penance, that hapned to the three accuſers of <hi>Narciſſus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> They accuſed him falſly of ſome horrid crimes, but in verification of their indictment bound themſelves by a curſe: The <hi>firſt</hi> that if his accuſation were falſe, he might be burn'd to death: The <hi>ſecond,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Euſeb. li. 6. c. 7.</note> that he might die of the Kings evil: The <hi>third,</hi> that he might be blinde. God in his anger found out the two firſt, and their curſe hapned to them that <hi>delighted in curſing and lies.</hi> The firſt was burnt alive in his own houſe: and the ſecond periſhed by the loathſome diſeaſe. Which when the third eſpied, and found Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:115796:369"/>ſo haſty and ſo heavy, ſo preſſing and ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he ran out to meet the rod of God; and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his ſin ſo deeply, and wept ſo bitterly, ſo continually, that he became blinde with weeping: and the anger of God became an inſtance of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; the judgement was ſanctified, and ſo paſſed into mercy and a pardon: he did indeed meet with his curſe, but by the arts of repentance the curſe became a bleſſing. And ſo it may be to us, <hi>Praeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niamus faciem ejus in confeſſione;</hi> let us prevent his anger by ſentencing our ſelves: or if we do not, let us follow the ſad accents of the angry voice of God, and imitate his juſtice, by condemning that which God condemnes, and ſuffering willingly what he impoſes; and turning his judgements into volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary executions, by applying the ſuffering to our ſins, and praying it may be ſanctified. For ſince God ſmites us that we may repent, if we repent then, we ſerve the end of the Divine judgement: and when we perceive God ſmites our ſin, if we ſubmit to it, and are pleaſed that our ſin is ſmitten, we are enemies to it, after the example of God; and that is a good act of repentance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="29"/> For the quality or kinde of penances, this is the beſt meaſure; Thoſe are the beſt which ſerve moſt ends; not thoſe which moſt vex us, but ſuch which will moſt pleaſe God. If they be only acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>punitive</hi> and <hi>vindictive,</hi> they doe indeed puniſh the man, and help ſo far as they can to deſtroy the ſin; but of theſe alone, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid well, <hi>Bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe profiteth but little;</hi> but of the later ſort, he added, <hi>but Godlineſs is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come:</hi> and this indeed is our exacteſt meaſure. Faſtings alone, lyings upon the ground, diſciplines and direct chaſtiſements of the body, which have nothing in them but toleration and revenge, are of
<pb n="685" facs="tcp:115796:369"/>ſome uſe; they vex the body, and crucify the ſinner, but the ſin lives for all them: but if we adde prayer, or any action ſymbolical, as meditation, reading, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarineſs, ſilence, there is much more done towards the extinction of the ſin. But he that addes <hi>alms,</hi> or ſomething that not onely is an act contrary to a former ſtate of ſin, but ſuch which is apt to depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the fault, to obey God, and to doe good to men, <hi>he hath choſen the better part, which will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily be taken from him.</hi> Faſting, prayer, and alms together are the beſt penances, or acts of exterior repentance in the world. If they be ſingle, faſting is of the leaſt force, and alms done in obedience and the love of God is the beſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="30"/> For the quantity of penances, the old rule is the beſt that I know, but that it is too general and indefinite. It is S. <hi>Cyprians, Quàm magna deliqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, tam granditèr defleamus.</hi> If our ſins were great, ſo muſt our ſorrow or penances be. As one is, ſo muſt be the other. For ſorrow and penances I reckon as the ſame thing in this queſtion; ſave onely that in ſome inſtances of corporall inflictions, the ſin is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in its proper matter; as intemperance is by faſting; effeminacy by ſuffering hardſhips; whereas ſorrow oppoſes it onely in general: and in ſome other inſtances of penances, there is a duty diſtinctly and directly ſerv'd, as in prayer and alms. But al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this rule be indefinite and unlimited, we find it made more minuit by <hi>Hugo de S. Victore. Si in correctione minor eſt afflictio quàm in culpâ fuit dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctatio, non eſt dignus poenitentiae tuae fructus.</hi> Our ſorrow either in the direct paſſion, or in its volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expreſſions, diſtinctly or conjunctly, muſt at leaſt equal the pleaſure we took in the committing of a ſin. And this rule is indeed very good, if we uſe it with theſe cautions. Firſt, that this be underſtood principally in our repentances for ſingle ſins; for
<pb n="686" facs="tcp:115796:370"/>in theſe onely the rule can be properly and without ſcruple applied, where the meaſures can be beſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. For in habitual and long courſes of ſin, there is no other meaſures but to doe very much, and very long, and until we die, and never think our ſelves ſafe, but while we are doing our repentances. Secondly, that this meaſure be not thought equal commutation for the ſin, but be onely uſed as an act of deprecation and repentance, of the hatred of ſin, and oppoſition to it; For he that ſets a value upon his punitive actions of repentance, and reſts in them, will be haſty in finiſhing the repentance, and leaving it off even while the ſin is alive: For in theſe caſes it is to be regarded, that penances, or the punitive acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of repentance, are not for the extinction of the <hi>puniſhment</hi> immediately, but for the <hi>guilt.</hi> That is, there is no remains of puniſhment after the whole guilt is taken off: but the guilt it ſelf goes away by parts, and theſe <hi>external</hi> actions of repentance have the ſame effect in their proportion which is wrought by the <hi>internal.</hi> Therefore as no man can ſay that he hath ſufficiently repented of his ſins by an inward ſorrow and hatred: ſo neither can he be ſecure that he hath made compenſation by the ſuffering penan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; for if one ſin deſerves an eternal hell, it is well if upon the account of any actions, and any ſufferings, we be at laſt accepted and acquitted.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="31"/> In the performing the punitive parts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal repentance, it is prudent, that we rather <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend</hi> them then <hi>intend</hi> them: that is, let us rather doe many ſingle acts of ſeveral inſtances, then dwell upon one with ſuch intenſion of ſpirit as may be apt to produce any violent effects upon the body or the ſpirit. In all theſe caſes, prudence and proportion to the end is our beſt meaſures. For theſe outward ſignifications of repentance, are not in any kinde or inſtance neceſſary to the conſtitution of repentance;
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:115796:370"/>but apt and excellent expreſſions, and ſignifications, exerciſes and miniſteries of repentance. Prayer and alms are of themſelves diſtinct duties, and therefore come not in their whole nature to this reckoning: but the preciſe acts of corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are here intended. And that theſe were not neceſſary parts of repentance, the primitive Church believed, and declared, by abſolving dying perſons, though they did not ſurvive the beginnings of their publick repentance. But that ſhe enjoyn'd them to ſuffer ſuch ſeverities in caſe they did recover, ſhe declar'd that theſe were uſeful and proper exerciſes and miniſteries of the Grace it ſelf. And although inward repentance did expiate all ſins, even in the Moſaical Covenant, yet they had alſo a time and manner of its ſolemnity, their day of expiation, and ſo muſt we have many. But if any man will refuſe this way of repentance, I ſhall onely ſay to him the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> to them who rejected the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical cuſtomes and uſages: <hi>We have no ſuch Cuſtome, neither the Churches of God.</hi> But let him be ſure that he perform his <hi>internal</hi> repentance with the more exactneſs; as he had need look to his own ſtrengths, that refuſes the aſſiſtance of auxili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries. But it is not good to be too nice and inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive, when the whole article is matter of practice. For what doth God demand of us but inward ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of of a <hi>returning, penitent, obedient heart,</hi> and that this be exerciſed and miniſtred unto by fit and convenient offices to that purpoſe? This is all, and from this we are to make no abatements.</p>
